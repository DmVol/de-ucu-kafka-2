worldnews,"&gt; Industry in China is still deeply entwined with the state. The notion that China just suddenly became capitalist is pervasive and misguided.

That's called state capitalism with a centralised planning system not socialism. 

&gt;Socialism refers to state ownership of the means of production

No, the workers own it, not the state. What usually happens is that the state assumes control over the means of production via authoritarianism. 

&gt;The Chinese government and communist party directly run the economy 

CCP is about as Communist as the Democrat People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) is Democratic. 

&gt;China is actually less socialist than Nordic model countries in the realm of wealth redistribution and tax rates.

Social democratic societies such as the Nordic Model operate under a capitalist framework. They just have generous welfare nets. 

&gt;Perhaps you can't actually call China socialist, perhaps they're something new and unique.

Not even Chinese people consider their government socialist. Words have meanings. 

Even under a ""state owned system"", the wealth needs to be redistributed and funneled into public welfare systems. The state should also not profit off of the enterprises and industries they own. 

To put it simply, you are incorrect in your assessment. China is a ruthless, authoritarian capitalist society that will break any rules needed to get ahead. That's why they are where they are in such a short span of time.",0,8

The latter -- the NK having little to no character -- is source of one of my major gripes: killing the NK doesn't feel meaningful. He's not an interesting character.

Despite receiving trillions of dollars in oil revenue over recent decades, Venezuela is in the midst of an unprecedented economic collapse, owing precisely to the redistributionist programs that Sanders has extolled as a model for the U.S. economy.

To complete the heel turn he'd have to kill Dany and/or his siblings to reveal his true nature.

I can't quite connect all the dots, but i do think there has to be some last swerve of this caliber to justify having the night king threat end so early. i figure most likely it's something like this, or at the least, it would involve dany nuking KL and forcing Jon to bring her to justice or something. I don't like that idea necessarily either, so Bran being the final boss would be both surprising but also not completely illogical.

It is super tiring and boring to talk to. I will happily chat to anyone, literally anyone, if they're just chill and being themselves and having a good time.

The other thing is that sometimes men try this, and even though they get better at conversations etc, they still think it's unfair or something when they don't get a girlfriend in like a week. It isn't about being ""friendzoned"" because you're the worst, it's the fact that not everyone will be your perfect bloody match. Think about how many people you meet and either think are just okay, or don't like that much. Then apply that same statistic to finding a partner, and heighten it a bit because you have to REALLY like someone and click with them to want to put your face close to their face (maybe unless drunk idk). It is NORMAL to struggle to find a good partner, and women struggle with this too, everyone does.

Oh yeah also being ""nice"" and ""respectful"" is literally the bare fucking minimum for being a good partner. Like, that's great, but it doesn't mean the universe owes you a partner. Everyone in my life who I choose to associate with on any reasonable level is ""nice"" and ""respectful."" Doesn't mean they are automatically my dream person.

relationship_advice,"If the relationship is not wholly fulfilling, it's probably a sign that the two of you aren't meant to be together. Also you are only 18, so while it could be possible, she is likely not the one. People who get together at a young age often don't end up staying together forever. Some do, but I would say, based on what you've said, it doesn't sound like it. Before you said you broke up with her because it didn't feel right, so you were likely right then. What you need to do is sit yourself down and think about whether or not you can continue this relationship. Can the good outweigh the bad or is there too much bad? I can't speak to it, obviously, because I am not you. Ultimately, you need to figure out if you can continue on in this relationship or not.",0,1

*****
&gt; The four-page letter that Mr. Barr sent to Congress two days later gave little detail about the special counsel&amp;#039;s findings and created the impression that Mr. Mueller&amp;#039;s team found no wrongdoing, allowing Mr. Trump to declare he had been exonerated.

&gt; When Mr. Mueller&amp;#039;s report was released on April 18, it painted a far more damning picture of the president and showed that Mr. Mueller believed that significant evidence existed that Mr. Trump obstructed justice.

&gt; The senior department officials also found Mr. Mueller&amp;#039;s rationale for stopping short of deciding whether Mr. Trump committed a crime to be confusing and contradictory, and they concluded that Mr. Mueller&amp;#039;s report showed that there was no case against Mr. Trump.

gameofthrones,"Any critique here gets downvoted and then the old вЂњdonвЂ™t watch it thenвЂќ bitchy remark. So expect that.
   Also, I try to suspend a lot of disbelief as far as military and martial and commentators sense tactics go. This show touts girl power to the enth degree especially lately and thatвЂ™s where Lyanna Mormont and such comes from. DonвЂ™t have much of an issue with that. Just think that Aryas been pumped up entirely too much. She was a half trained assassin who spent way more time getting her ass kicked than kicking ass. As I said, Jaime or Theon killing the NK wouldвЂ™ve made much more sense than Arya doing it. It just didnвЂ™t fit for me. 
    The crypt scene was a huge waste. The fact that dead Starks came out of their resting place to kill shouldвЂ™ve been presented differently, not to mention, whatвЂ™s the statute of limitations on the NK resurrections? Those were 100+ year old dead bodies. 
    I did like how Melisandre died however. Her purpose was carried out, she took her amulet off and her very old body gave up, that couldвЂ™ve been slightly more epic but whatever. I understand that our lead cast canвЂ™t die unceremoniously, but soldiers die with no pomp or circumstance all the time. 
   There were things done right, and things done wrong. The music and cinematography were completely on point, it was the storyline that I disliked, especially the whole Walking Dead in the library experience Arya had....very cheap. 
    And IвЂ™m expecting shit for this, but halfway through this season already and I am not liking what IвЂ™ve seen thus far. After S4, the show went downhill. I still love it as a whole though.",0,1

nba,"Let's calculate how much we have to make the three worth to get to this. If it was worth 2.675 points instead of 3 would we achieve the perfect harmony of offensive strategy? 

Let's go all out and embrace the video game world. The NBA and video games seem to have the same general audience already, why not further blur those lines? 

Getting back to back blocks on the same player in the same possession gives your team a red shell and automatically forces the opposing coach to sub out that player in shame at the next dead ball and keep them on the bench for at least five minutes of game time. 

Maybe add rewards for consecutive made shots of the same type being worth more or less. Hit three ""three's"" in a row and unlock a holographic power star. Power stars grant you +1 points per made shot, +0.5 points per assisted shot, and immunity from foul calls for 30 seconds.

news,"Thanks for the interesting response, this sheds a bit more light on how it came about. 

I've been trying to understand what was actually going on during the cold war in SA, and how people in the US and abroad felt about it, as it's not something that's taught in US schools. 

For example, was the coup against Arbenz in Guatamala viewed similarly? 

Do people believe Armas was better than Arbenz? I've heard people say this and all the other similar coups in SA were victories for freedom and democracy,  but in every case I've read (guatamala, hondurous, chile, nicaragua) the people who replaced the communist/socialists were far more repressive and anti-democratic than those they replaced. 

In this modern case with Guaido it doesn't seem to be the case, but that's why I'm wondering if people also thought the same thing when supporting those other coups.",0,0

In states where it is not mandated, you are *still* prohibited from selling a gun to someone known to be a prohibited person, so owners will frequently require some proof to that effect, such as a concealed carry permit. Gun owners have called for, time and again, the NICS system to be opened to the public, even at a nominal fee, so that they can do their own background checks when selling their firearms. The only other exception I know of to the background check requirement are some states which allow things like a concealed carry license/permit in lieu, but to have one of those, you must *already* have passed a background check.",0,59

&gt; WASHINGTON- Glaciers are set to disappear completely from almost half of World Heritage sites if business-as-usual emissions continue, according to the first-ever global study of World Heritage glaciers.

&gt; The authors predict glacier extinction by 2100 under a high emission scenario in 21 of the 46 natural World Heritage sites where glaciers are currently found.

&gt; The authors of the study also developed the first ever inventory of glaciers on the UNESCO World Heritage list, documenting about 19,000 glaciers present in 46 out of the 247 natural World Heritage sites.

AskReddit,"I'm venting more so than anything else on an account I haven't used since like 2016/7 - I'm a fifteen year old gay guy, in my last year of compulsory education in high school (UK) for a bit of context and it's been about half a year since this happened but I haven't been able to process it all that well. 

To put it shortly, I was in an abusive relationship for almost a year and (upon breakup) my now ex pretended to kill themself three times in the span of 12 hours. I remember mourning them so vividly, screaming about how i had killed them to a friend who later suggested that I talk again to them because we were both just kids despite being aware of what they had put me through even prior to the event. Every time they returned again, I felt betrayed and conflicted because on one hand I was so, so happy they were alive but on the other I couldn't breathe knowing they had used the thing they had done to get together with me (I had to ""confess"" I loved them to stop them from killing themselves on a call one night because I was dating someone that wasn't them who I ended up dumping after we drifted apart - I really hope they're doing better these days) to hurt me so much. 

I've been to therapy, it's not the best but it's helping. Talking about it has helped a lot but there's really not much you can do when you're so young I guess. I'm still trying to come to terms with the whole ordeal as the (almost) year of emotional manipulation and abuse is something I am still feeling the repercussions of. 

Despite that I'm here, I've tried to take my life about 12 times in the past year (majority being post break up) but never gone through fully at the thought of the wonderful friends I've made after regaining my autonomy I'd lost due to ex's controlling nature - a specific one being someone I regard as a sister at this point.

That was never true for Ned, Stannis, or Robb.",0,15

However, I don't think that should nullify the rules we've been playing with since the beginning. Fighting off dozens of wights because you're a badass swordsman? Sure! Surviving as an overweight coward who fell multiple times, has next-to-zero battle training, and whimpered while being overwhelmed? Doesn't make sense. Being completely surrounded and backed into a wall without the space to even swing your sword, and then magically being ok the next scene? Doesn't make sense. If you want these legendary characters, actually show them beating the odds rather than just baiting their deaths, cutting away, and then showing them safe.

2) **You** requested I give you the name of a black republican who could be elected by the party as president.  Now you're saying that is just tokenism.

3) **You** said the republicans would never elect a black person as president, but there only has to be one black person who could be elected as president to prove that's not true; you're now saying ""one or two isn't proof of anything.""

The truth is, the only way for me to prove that there is a black person that can be elected president by the republican party is for there to already have been a black person who has been elected president by the republican party.  Otherwise, you can always just say that person would never get elected.  Without Obama, you'd be in the exact same position with respect to the democrat party.  Obama was the most talented politician we've in decades -- had he been a republican, I think he would have been elected president as a republican.

politics,"Well one thing to keep in mind is that the appt of the special counsel meant Rosenstein had very little say in the course and direction of the investigation as long as Mueller stayed within pre-existing legal perameters. The whole point of a special counsel is to create distance from the President and justice department influence.

But you're correct that to the extent that Rosenstein had some control over aspects of it (like his judgment with Barr after mueller submitted the report) it would be improper for Trump to discuss any of the ins and outs of that decision or influence it in any way. I don't think that is implied by Rods letter though. 

It still might have happened I don't know. I personally doubt it, but it's possible, and I'll grant that it's worth looking in to. Maybe Congress will ask him to testify about that. They will likely ask Barr those types of questions at some point.",0,2

politics,"

AOC made some other good comments about pelosi in that article which explain policy positions.

https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-congress-interview-797214/

&gt; One thing that is notable about the speaker [Pelosi] is that she does believe that the Democratic Party should be a progressive party. She is in the difficult position of having to juggle all of these different wings within the party, but her personal politics are very progressive. I have not found an issue where we are really opposed...

&gt; I donвЂ™t want to compromise where weвЂ™re going, but IвЂ™m willing to compromise on how we get there. I believe in single-payer health care, so that every American is covered with physical, mental and dental health care that is free of cost. ThatвЂ™s my vision. If I lobby the caucus enough so that our most conservative members fight for a public option, thatвЂ™s a huge win...

I'd encourage you to consider the hypothesis that it not's ""centrist"" dems that suck so much, it's really the people they represent. (Due largely to the authoritarian propaganda machine).

A good piece of evidence that this is real, and not made up by neo-liberals to stop progressive legislation, is to study US populations and their representatives. 

There's no ""AOC of Alabama"", even though I guarantee there are people living in Alabama who could be their AOC.

The best progressives in congress right now all represent high left populations. And when you start talking about statewide and national representative strategy, it's really important to accept the reality of those populations, keeping the house requires not getting the constituents of those people pissed off, and just trying to not give a supermajority to the GOP in the senate requires the same.

politics,"That's the conventional wisdom, but has it really been proven to work? The biggest criticisms I've heard about losing democratic tickets over the years was that they lacked clear message. Voters didn't have a strong sense of what the candidate(s) actually stood for. Certainly Clinton/Kaine suffered from a less clear definition of what they stood for compared to their competition (as ugly as what Trump stood for was, it was at least crystal clear).

&amp;#x200B;

I really wonder if picking a VP that is ideologically similar, that can passionately articulate what their administration will represent, would be a better strategy than trying to spread the ticket's appeal with some other swing state Senator/Governor with a different ideology. A Warren/Sanders ticket would have an incredibly strong brand among Democrats and progressives. I think a strong ticket identity will fare against Trump in 2020 than the usual Democrat approach of trying to broaden reach.",0,1

&gt; &amp;quot;Brazil is on the side of the people of Venezuela, President Juan Guaido and the freedom of Venezuelans,&amp;quot; Bolsonaro said in a series of tweets.

AskReddit,"Not a medical worker and in my case this isn't about haunting last words. Sometimes not even knowing is haunting.  


My grandmother had dementia. And my siblings as well as my parents were always around her and my grandfather to take care of them. We went away for a three week vacation and my dads sisters came around to watch my grandparents and take care of them. When we got back my grandmother's entire demeanor had changed. She went from loving us, talking to us daily and having full trust to out right hating us. She screamed at my older brother and our mother to get out of her house and never set foot in it again. We were accused of beating, stealing, coercing, and other crimes against my grandparents.  
My father's sisters used my grandmothers dementia to warp her mind into believing we were out to get her despite being there for her and my grandfather for years prior, trying to keep them going through their rapidly decreasing health. My grandparents were fairly wealthy and we knew my aunts were trying to get their money. We went to court twice with them to defend ourselves against the accusations. My aunts never won, but I still never saw my grandparents again. The damage was done.  


My grandmother passed about two years later and my grandfather followed after another two. I will never know if my grandmother, who practically raised me and my older brother while our parents worked their butts off, died hating us, loving us, or maybe not evening remembering. And I will never know if they died alone or had someone beside them. I think of both of them often and it still haunts me.  


And in case anyone was wondering, my grandfather had suffered a massive stroke years before this all went down and as such wasn't always quite lucid, so while all this went down he didn't fully care is how I would imagine, or maybe didn't fully grasp the situation.",0,1

13% range buff on his Q? Rank 1 slow of 50% for 2 fucking seconds?! That's god damn amazing.

And now you can just spam E in every trade since it's free. 

And his rank 3 ult just got a fucking 30% range buff. I bet you can ult from drake to Baron now... That's a big deal!

There's a real chance that Tahm Kench comes away from these changes stronger than before... The way I see it, his W being good is now dependent on Tahm having flash. As long as TK has flash up, he's still going to be able to get his ADC out safely. If flash is down, it will probably just end up resulting in TK dying but at least the ADC lives.",0,3

Bio was my first period, so it's the first place I'd go in the morning to put my stuff down before wandering around until the day started. This day though I had gotten shit sleep so I put my stuff down and lay my head on the desk to try and get some napping in before I had to be truly awake.

Collen was also in the bio room, getting early morning tutoring from the teacher. The teacher was this nice little Asian lady who had only been teaching a couple of years at this point. She's going over a past test with him, and he's clearly not picking up on much of anything that she says, and so he's getting annoyed.

Eventually he's done with it. He slams the pencil down and say something like, ""fuck this crap"" and starts walking to the door. Before he can make it all the way out, my teacher yells for him, and he turns to face her. She just looks at him and goes ""You're a jackass. I don't know if you realize it, but I hear plenty of other kids talking about how annoying you are. If school was anything like survivor, you'd be first one voted off the island, and everyone would celebrate after."" She said it so smoothly like she was thinking it up as she was tutoring him. Me and the other couple of kids in the room are just silent. All he could muster was a ""Cool."" Before stepping out.

The bell rang and the rest of the class came in and nothing seemed to come of it all. Everything just continued like normal. I didn't have bio with Collen so I'm not sure if he behaved any differently in her class afterwards.",0,2

As for my response to your points, I can see what you mean about the Blues with what you say up to this point:

&gt;Can you honestly say that the Blues are worse than Senators or Oilers before the season ? Hell no.

And I agree with everything you've said up until that point. You're right, starting the season on paper the Blues were supposed to actually be one of the more dominant teams in the NHL with their offseason acquisitions. But it was more than just the goaltending that had problems. At one point we had the lowest Goals For in the entire league which is obviously not a problem that bringing in a new goaltender solved. Coaching helped there which is why Berube also got the nomination for Jack Adams, but for nearly everything else Binnington has pretty much been the solution. Our defense looks a hell of a lot better than it did originally, but to be honest it still looks pretty weak and I'm seeing Binnington have to make 1 to 2 desperation saves nearly every game. 

But what I'm trying to say is that no, before the season I wouldn't have said the Blues were going to be worse than the Senators or Oilers. But after watching 4 straight months of them prove that wrong, I was resigned to the fact that we were going to finish 31st in the league. I had 0 hope on Jan 1st that they'd ever turn it around. When they turned it around I was absolutely floored as a Blues fan. A team doesn't magically turn into a scoring powerhouse just because a goaltender starts heating up. And yet somehow, they did. Even when Berube first came on nothing seemed to change. It wasn't until Binnington's debut that they started dominating. I've never seen anything like it in my life as a hockey fan. 

As for how Binnington is not nominated for Vezina, his competition is other goaltenders who have more games under their belt with equally incredible stats. I think that when you're comparing goalie to goalie you have to look at games played very objectively and can say ""well obviously Binner didn't come close to the GP that Vasi did and he still had incredible stats"". 

But with Calder, my opinions on that are different. You shouldn't be able to compare goaltenders to skaters honestly. 32 games as a goalie is still a large chunk when you consider there are plenty of starters that only hit ~50. So when everyone says ""Binnington's played less than half the season"" that's technically true, but he's also played damn near the ENTIRE half of the season whereas plenty of other starters play ~15 games over half the season but they do it all season long. Add in the fact that no NHL goalie ever *starts* the first game of the season for a debut (goalies literally have to wait for 1 of 2 goalies to go down before they get a call up in nearly every case) whereas a skater can just get called up and poof you toss one of the other 12 forwards you've got down to the minors. 

Look I know he's not going to win it over Petey. But goalies aren't expected to get a call up at the start of the year so without taking candidates like this one seriously you'll never get Calder-winning goaltenders.",0,1

&gt; TOKYO - Japanese Emperor Akihito announced his abdication at a palace ceremony Tuesday in his final address, as the nation embraced the end of his reign with reminiscence and hope for a new era.

&gt; &amp;quot;Since ascending the throne 30 years ago, I have performed my duties as the emperor with a deep sense of trust in and respect for the people, and I consider myself most fortunate to have been able to do so. I sincerely thank the people who accepted and supported me in my role as the symbol of the state,&amp;quot; Akihito said in his last official duty as emperor.

&gt; Trump had a courtesy meeting with Akihito during his 2017 Japan visit and will be the first foreign leader in May to meet the new emperor.

There's some fundamental miss in both Marx and Lenin that doesn't take into account some important  natural human factors issue, and that seems to cause communist states to be forced to resort to ""reprogramming"" people in various ways.

He tried to turn a versatile pass catching running back like David Johnson into an up the middle workhorse or made David Johnson stay back for pass protection most times even tho that has always been JohnsonвЂ™s biggest weakness.

But at the same time I just wanted to see Rosen move the offense or show those flashes you want to see.

His first game was honestly really awesome but after that it really became bleak.

And then as the season progressed he got worse and worse and started over throwing many receivers. 

Everybody in the building from keim to the players all defended Rosen and still have after being traded . It wouldвЂ™ve been very easy for anybody to throw Rosen under the bus but not one person did.

gameofthrones,"&gt;Helm's deep had a way bigger wall

Wider? Yes. Taller, not really. If you go back and look at pics, it's not as big as one would've imagined. The only tall part is the actual main castle's wall.

&gt;wight must be killed or else it will keep attacking at full strength

This part actually confuses me. We can see very clearly in Jorah's final stand that a single slash to any part of the body kills them instantly. Need to go back and confirm, but I'm under the impression that a single slash or stab kills them, as does how White Walkers die (seen with both Valyrian steel and dragonglass).

&gt;focused the enemy's attack to a relatively small surface area  
&gt;  
&gt;area of Winterfell that must be defended by an onslaught is much larger

True, I'd agree with that. I guess we can even the playing fields by discussing from the point AFTER the walls have been breached (e.g. Elven archers prepared for shooting upon breach). But going back to the major point, Winterfell could've done a heck of a lot better job in coordination and strategy. Dragons were also utilized so poorly.

relationship_advice,"OPвЂ™s friend that he speaks of is the 34 year old man, not the teenager. 

An 8 year year age gap where the couple has things in common, like your situation, is not the same as 15 year age gap between a man in his mid 30s and a teen who just got out of high school. Generally speaking the impact of an age gap lessens, the older the couple are. 16 and 24 is an 8 year gap. But so is 51 and 59.

From Iron Man - ""proof Tony has a heart"", the fact that Tony likes cheeseburgers, and that Tony wishes he could have said goodbye to his father

From Iron Man 2 - when Tony says ""it's always you"" at the end of his recording in the Benatar, it references when he made Pepper CEO and said ""it's you. it's always been you"". Additionally, this film fleshes out Tony's relationship with his father.

From Thor 1 and Captain America 1 - the city where Odin fought the frost giants and where Red Skull found the tesseract is TГёnsberg, the same city where New Asgard is placed in this movie. 

From Captain America 1 - ""I could do this all day"", and then Cap and Bucky's lines when they say goodbye to each other at the start of this film are the same as when they say goodbye at the end of Endgame except switched - Cap says what Bucky said before and Bucky says what Cap said before. ""Don't do anything stupid."" ""you're taking all the stupid with you.""

From Captain America 2 - ""On your left"" &amp; the elevator scene

Age of Ultron - the things that Tony is mad at Cap for saying were said in Age of Ultron. ""We'll lose."" ""Then we'll do that together too.""

You mean that thing they tried to sneak chickenwire and other rioting gears through? Don't forget that we blocked Venezuela and Cuva's aid after Katrina, and they don't tend to use humanitarian aid to justify foreign intervention.

&gt;It also had food, medicine, and basic supplies. Who's overthrowing governments with chicken wire? Do you know what chicken wire is?

&gt; China Building Hundreds Of Coal-Fired Power Plants Abroad China has taken dramatic steps to fight climate change, including shutting major coal power plants.

&gt; Edward Cunningham, a specialist on China and its energy markets at Harvard University, tells NPR that China is building or planning more than 300 coal plants in places as widely spread as Turkey, Vietnam, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Egypt and the Philippines.

&gt; In one sense, China&amp;#039;s push for coal is not surprising: China knows how to build coal plants.

Seems like it would be more logical to just make some exceptions in the law for these instances than to just dismiss it with a hand wave and say itвЂ™s fine because itвЂ™s a minority of felons. As if itвЂ™s either ALL felons can vote or NO felons can vote, which is a false dichotomy; you can allow some/most felons to vote if you write the law as such.

worldnews,"&gt; After all, when has a country ever successfully used guns to resist an oppressive government and gone on to free themselves and create the most successful, productive democracy and documents like a constitution that guarantees personal rights and freedoms like speech and voting and free thought and religion? It's never happened.

The Revolutionary War in the US is much different than the situation is Venezuela. It was the colonies collectively working together with a common government and army against another country. This is more like a civil war. The Civil War in the US is an example you are seeking, except it was unsuccessful for the people resisting the government. Not saying the current dictator in Venezuela is the good guy or anything, just saying having guns isn't necessarily going to get you anywhere. This is a complex situation and I'm not saying people shouldn't be able to rise up and fight for what they believe, I'm simply saying that having a gun doesn't give you the power you necessarily think it does. Unorganized civilians with guns is not an Army, has no infrastructure, and is not a match for a military or police forces. The best thing people can do is continue to protest, I don't think a few shootouts in the streets are going to change much. It will take time for the economic sanctions and pressure from the outside to make Maduro step down but a little time is a much better price than a bloody civil war.",0,-1

politics,"Rage-induced mass shootings do not require the shooter to have a conceal carry permit, unfortunately.

The problem is that while it is difficult to get a conceal carry permit in Colorado, itвЂ™s absurdly easy to buy guns anyway.  Any person over 18 years old that can pass a low-level background check run by the store can buy long guns, and anyone over 21 can buy hand guns too.  Open carry is permit-free, so in a way, the mass shooter isnвЂ™t even breaking the law until theyвЂ™re inside the building and fire the first shot.

The minimal burden at the bottom - requiring a safety course and issuing through police department (naturally skeptical of citizens having guns) rather than a private dealer (who actively wants to sell guns - as many as possible) - makes the big difference in gun violence.

marvelstudios,"Nebula and Gamora were there. Nakia and Sif weren't even in the movie, and I'm sure they would have put Nakia in the scene if they got Lupita Nyong'o in the movie. Sif would probably raise to many questions. I already explained to you why it's a stupid to compare to 12 male characters showing up. 
The reason there aren't as many female characters, is because the people that watch these movies used to be mainly men, but it's starting to change, which is why you're starting to see more female characters on screen. There also aren't nearly as many iconic female Marvel characters to adapt to the big screen as there are male characters, which makes it more difficult to have as many females on screen. Not to mention that having more female characters, just for the sake of having as many of them as male characters is the wrong way to go about it. If the character is great, and there's a big demand for it, make a movie about him or her. Don't make a movie about a character, just because she's a woman.
The point is that the scene was forced and genuinely took people out of the movie, men and women alike. The characters didn't gather there because the story warranted it, they didn't even know each other, and after they had their girl power money shot, they didn't even do anything together, they just went about killing goons individually. It was so obvious and in your face that I'm surprised there's actually people defending it.",0,0

IвЂ™m sorry but being drunk isnвЂ™t an excuse. IвЂ™m sure there are people that come out stronger after giving their partner a second chance but most of the time a second chance shouldnвЂ™t be given.  ThatвЂ™s what IвЂ™ve learned from experience.

leagueoflegends,"As someone who played a decent amount of top Kench this past year, some of the points are either overblown, or wrong:

\&gt;   he becomes a slow skarner: no mspd, has to hit 3 times to press W, can't even move enemies well, and QSS 

\&gt; hard counters devour. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is selling him a little short.  In teamfights with juggernauts/tank, Kench can realistically get his devour off multiple times with high CDR (especially now with, if the ""CD refund on enemies"" still acts the same)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;  Thus his early game trading is worse both in damage and in mana 

&amp;#x200B;

This is ignoring the damage buff he got early from his passive getting flattened, and the mana reduction on his actual devour of the enemy champ.  His E also costs no mana either, which huge for him to not need to consider popping it in each auto trade for the extra shield bash damage.  His waveclear took a huge hit in all forms, but everything else is quite similar.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall there are some pretty brutal nerfs to some of his top lane damage (all of it on his W).  I've always run a W&gt;Q&gt;E skill order and that is unquestionable nerfed to the ground, but Q max first may have potential (longer range, stronger slow, faster base ms to rush the enemy), but he still seems worse late game in almost every way as a top laner.",0,7

Turn a corner and get headshot? You can jiggle peek. Shoulder peek. Flash them off. Molly them out of their position. Smoke them off. The game is a lot more than just peeking angles and clicking heads. Utility is huge in high-level CS:GO; there's a reason why teams like Astralis are so great on maps like Inferno. You'll get naded down to half your health before you can even see one of them. Conversely, you can nade them down. Mind games. Do I try to take map control and risk taking utility damage? Or do I give up map control, take somewhere else, and go back once the other team has used their utility/rotated?

I can't see how you can judge CS:GO this harshly with only 40 hours played; like u/itirate said, it's a lot more than clicking heads.",0,9

gameofthrones,"1. What are Tyrion and the rest of the south supposed to do? Daenerys has two dragons (three at the time of the Tarly's execution) and two full armies that she's controlling. And I flat out disagree with the notion that Tyrion as a character HAD to do something even if he disagreed with the killing of the Tarly's. Followers questioning the decisions of their leader without acting is something that happens in real life. The consequences of Daenerys' actions are that people don't view her the same as they used to; Tyrion and Varys have lost some faith in her. We still haven't seen the end of her story either, so let's see how it plays out. 

2. The Waif was sent to kill Arya, and Arya fended her off, killing her in the process. Is she supposed to be penalized for surviving and fighting for her life? We saw the consequences of Arya's actions of killing Meryn Trant, they just didn't play out with Arya losing her life, it was the Waif. The Many-Faced God was repaid with a face. Furthermore, we've always known that Jaqen H'ghar is somewhat fond of Arya, so it's not out of character that he would allow her to leave. She completed her training.

3. The stories of Dorne, The Reach and The Stormlands were complete. And if you disagree with me, that's fine, but sometimes you have to sacrifice story for other story. There are only so many episodes in a season, and so many seasons of a show. I don't feel like I missed anything in those locations.

4. The people of the North realized that they needed the Wildlings on their side to fight the war, and Jon made this point numerous times after being questioned about it.

5. Tyrion's strategic blunders have been acknowledged by Dany, but again, the story isn't complete. She clearly thinks that he is still the best person for the job despite some errors in judgment, which she approved by the way, so it's not all on him.

6. Cersei is the clear next in line after Tommen's death. She's the blood of the former king and there's nobody else that could fill the role. She's also ruling with an iron fist, so people are scared of her. She has The Mountain by her side and just showed that she is capable and willing to kill a lot of people. Who's going to challenge that? The people of King's Landing so they can get wiped out by the Lannister Army? And you're right, I don't care at all that Kevan Lannister was killed and i'm glad no more time was spent on that. He was a worthless character.

7. The Dothraki charging into battle was meant to draw the Night King out so Dany and Jon could jump him with their dragons. Sometimes you have to make sacrifices to win the war. Did it play out as intended? No. Was it the absolute optimal strategic decision? No. Jon and Dany aren't great war tacticians and they did make strafing runs over the horde of Wights, but Dany decided to pursue the NK and Jon went after her. Dany isn't a rational character, so this isn't a plot hole in my opinion.",0,2

AmItheAsshole,"IвЂ™m a woman and didnвЂ™t have a sex toy at 12 but given when I was raised, I was sexually repressed and didnвЂ™t really know that girls masturbating, I thought only boys did. I also likely didnвЂ™t masturbate because I couldnвЂ™t orgasm just by my hands, so I stopped trying. But once I was 17 and had my first orgasm with someone else, I bought a vibrator online without my parents knowing and have been masturbating regularly since, only with the use of a vibrator.  

HOWEVER, if I ever have kids, particularly girls, I certainly will do what your wife did and help my daughter by her first vibrator at an age which children typically start masturbating (like 12-14) and have an open and candid conversation with them about masturbating and what is healthy and what isnвЂ™t, and which vibrators can be used with which lube, etc. if I have boys, I would ensure my husband or the boys father have a similar conversation with him, but them lube and tissues and whatever else they may need, and talk to them  about the same types of things, whatвЂ™s healthy and unhealthy, and about porn and what is realistic and what isnвЂ™t and to make sure they understand that porn is imaginary. Girls need this conversation too. I would ensure that my daughters knows that the conversations we have together are confidential and arenвЂ™t shared with my husband or her siblings (similar to conversations about puberty and mensuration), and I except the same to happen with my husband and my son, however we each need to know that these conversations are taking place so neither one is surprised. But I do understand why your wife hid it from you, she wanted her daughter to trust her and knew that you would react the way you did, but she probably should have gone about it in a different way. 

 You NEED to start early with these conversations and sex positivity because if you start too late, like 16 or 17, thereвЂ™s a good chance your child has already started having sex and thinks they know everything already, these conversations need to start far earlier than you may think is appropriate for them to be effective. 

I teach high school sex Ed, mainly to freshmen, and by the time I get to the sex ed unit with my kiddos, who are an average age of 14, many of them are already sexual active and already think they know everything about sex And are unwilling to listen to me... 12 is NOT too early for a young woman to start exploring her body sexually, and itвЂ™s far better to be under the guidance of her mom than entirely on her own, possibly sticking things up her vagina and causing a yeast infection or never getting the opportunity to orgasm on her own and then jumping into sex far too early just for sexual gratification.

My advice to you is to give up the fight about your daughter owning a vibrator bought by her mother and start a conversation with your wife about being a team and making these decisions together. Realize that while you are your daughters parent, your wife is a woman and knows a bit more about female sexuality than you do and that you may be wrong on this one, but you BOTH should be discussing these things together privately before discussing them with your children.

And that will be the hard part. Finally admitting that you sunk all this energy into a lost cause.

freefolk,"&gt;Arys Oakheart had 1 chapter (2?) and he died immediately. Arys Oakheart is the dumbest character in the series.

Not sure how having one chapter and dying is a metric for intelligence?

&gt;She makes those blunders because she's losing her mind. I don't know how you missed that. That's why we have Cersei's POV in that book, to see her descent into madness.

Saying that she is ""losing her mind"" is a gross exaggeration. Cersei is paranoid about prophecy after Joffrey's death and that's it. She is not exactly mad in a medical sense. And Cersei was always stupid, from the very beginning. It wasn't as apparent initially because there was always someone who had her under control - Robert, Tyrion, Tywin. The only time before Tywin's death when she was in charge was shortly after Ned's death and Tywin was so appalled at how the things were handled, he quickly sent Tyrion to take charge instead.

&gt;Also, Cersei makes similar blunders in the show. Like legitimizing and militarizing the sparrows.

Yes, because the showwriters wanted to adapt that storyline.

&gt;Cersei in the books also organizes the downfall of Margaery. In the show, she doesn't really do shit to bring down Margaery. Instead a male whore does it in the most convoluted way.

She tried to organise Margaery's downfall, what she did organise was in fact her own downfall as she fell into the very trap she herself created for Margaery. While Margaery is about to go free relatively untouched and the Tyrells took over KL. All because of Cersei's ""plan"".",0,2

news,"Why didnвЂ™t I buy a home in Boston Edison? What you mean is you have no fucking clue how property taxes in the city work. Those 5k houses were gutted ruins that needed 50k+ in Reno and would cost 20k a year in taxes even after 2008вЂ™s NEZ.

I personally, like a lot of people with credit, wasnвЂ™t looking for the utter gamble of property spec and being a shitty slum lord - but was invested in an actual business.

DetroitвЂ™s property taxes did not go by market value, they went by city appraised value - which was often time 10x the market value, or more, especially in BE or Indian Village.

I grew up in Warrendale and lived in various neighborhoods my entire life save a stint as a teenager and my time in Iraq. IвЂ™ve lived everywhere from SW to Delray to the East Side to Downtown and even in the end, around Eastern Market - where some friends owned a building and when they rejected a low ball price from out of state investors they started hammering us with inspectors until they were forced to sell due to code violation fines for dumb, bureaucratic shit.

Do you think people in Detroit 15 years ago just had the money and credit to engage in housing speculation - or compete with outside money that came flooding in after 2008? Everyone was trying to hold on to what they had left. This comment is astoundingly divorced from reality. Bizzaro world shit.

https://prospect.org/article/destruction-black-wealth

Up until 2011, when I left, the proceeding years were not ripe with opportunity - they were a desperate struggle. вЂњWhy didnвЂ™t you just get a bumch of lines of credit to buy a bunch of 
dilapidated assets you have no assurance will ever actually mature while paying obscene taxes - in the midst of a housing bubble, or the intervening catastrophe followingвЂќ. How shit, what?

No, you didnвЂ™t вЂњsupport DetroitвЂќ by sticking a D on the back of your car, coming down for DEMF or to stumble back to the MGM lot after getting blotto at McShanes or Greektown from OLdS. You were engaging in commerce, trade - thatвЂ™s it.

No I would not live on the east side again. Why would I? My people are all gone. The connections, friends, family, business partners - two decades worth of social capital scattered to the wind.

I left to another city to go to university and stayed abouts. I make sure to not clean up my neighborhood TOO much, not to make the bus stops TOO much, because itвЂ™s all thatвЂ™s keeping a 5 guys off my corner and a Dan Gilbert from realizing weвЂ™re conveniently close to downtown. I may own my house now, but a lot my neighbors donвЂ™t - and I recognize that a city is people, not a just a place for people to come play in once in a while.

And for real, I used to walk all the way down Grand River from E. Grand to the Leland on FridayвЂ™s/SaturdayвЂ™s and never had a problem -   Corktown was never even that bad, and far better than tons of areas further from downtown including the one I lived in. You just couldnвЂ™t walk around drunk and clueless. ThatвЂ™s it.

Do yourself a favor and go read some Community Economic Development from any Uni if you actually desire to have an informed opinion - MSU has plenty of good, empirical, work. Gentrification became such a commonly dirty word because of how intensely all of

&gt; We&amp;#039;re broadcasting from Washington, D.C. In breaking news, Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaid&amp;oacute; says a coup is underway in Caracas.

&gt; Guaid&amp;oacute; appeared alongside formerly jailed opposition leader Leopoldo L&amp;oacute;pez, who said he had been freed by military officers loyal to the opposition.

&gt; Venezuela&amp;#039;s Socialist Party leader called on government supporters to amass at the presidential palace to defend President Nicol&amp;aacute;s Maduro against what he called a &amp;quot;Small uprising of traitorous [military] soldiers backed by the U.S.&amp;quot; Venezuela&amp;#039;s defense minister said the Maduro government remains in control and that military units reported normality at barracks and bases across Venezuela.

AmItheAsshole,"NAH I might not be the most qualified to say this but then again you are asking this on Reddit. I feel you should be allowed to feel this way about seeing your daughter looking at these kind of things but I don't think you approached the situation in the best way, maybe talking to her and getting some woman's insight from your wife may have resulted in a better outcome. Although your wife has a valid point in trying to help along a healthy sex life she shouldn't have undermined your parental authority like that in front of your daughter. You should talk to your wife in private about respecting each other's authority as well as talk to your daughter together in order to help her and work out some understanding among the three of you. I know it may be uncomfortable to talk about these things but it's better than having your daughter grow up thinking sex is a bad thing that shouldn't be thought of or even becoming rebellious and doing things she really shouldn't. Do what you will with this advice and I hope it goes well for you and your family.",0,1

These are babies born to unbelievable pain and no prospects for making it more than a few days or weeks at most. 

But it also implies that if it were up to Trump he would allow babies with terminal diseases that are suffering unbearable pain to continue to suffer for days or weeks.

In third grade I was beat up by the class bully IN THE CLASS ROOM whenever the teacher left the room. One time, one of the bullies saw me getting on the church bus after dinner to go to a revival and he got on too. At the revival, he walked up to me and busted my lip open.

I was one of those kids who were probably just one more beating, one more embarrassment, one more terrifying day away from finding a weapon. Hell, I'm 50 years old and I still haven't been able to put these issues to bed.

In unreal tournament and quake its basically a quest to dominate the power up rotation once you get a good gun also its a case of spawning near a good gun, getting to the power ups first etc. Fighting games its a case of guessing the right frame and the right counter at the right time. its a lot harder than it sounds but man have I beat people way better than me by having them not be able guess my mix ups and flow charts and being able to read their current strategy then i win quit, I have also lost to people way worse than me pressing random ass buttons because somehow them not following the game rules works and and I just happened to start off with a combo with enough frames to be countered. Like using a different move I coulda won its rock, paper, scissors with more options but luck is still very much there. Titan fall 2 A good team thats balanced out can get fucked up if the worse team has 2 really good players distributing the damage just between them getting their titans out first and changing the game tide. Hell in real life competition luck exists. If I could remove luck from the equation of mma and video games I would....Scratch that just remove it it when luck works against me. There is just no such thing as fair. Luck is always random and always a huge influence over everything. Like if you were able to have every competition where the competitors were close in skill through out history play out a 100 different times who knows how the result would be each time. I bet they wouldn't be the same each time. Also fighting games are the most fair games on this planet and the least played.

politics,"&gt;I think you interact with people you disrespect just so that you can assign your own incorrect assessment on their words to set up your insults.  

When you take a position you can't back up with facts, no assumptions are needed.  It's very obvious. 

&gt;Of COURSE the chair has input. Every senator has input! 

Every Senator has input for their own assignments.  There are no votes on committee members.  The decisions are made by the party leader.  And no Democrat has control over who the Republicans put on the committee.  And you can't throw people off the committee without good reason (think Steve King).  The Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee in the 102nd Congress (1991-1993) were the exact same as the members in the 101st Congress.  So you're seriously blaming Joe Biden because, after the 1988 elections, Democrats didn't put Barbara Mikulski on the committee in preparation for a Supreme Court hearing in 1991?  Absolutely ridiculous.   You're stretching like no one has ever stretched before to find a way to blame Joe Biden. 

&gt;Just because the chair isn't the *final arbiter* doesn't mean they don't have a say.  I said *input*, not control. At the very least, they have their own vote and their own voice when the committee members are chosen.  And I never said or implied that members are selected for specific hearings.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The Senate lawyer questioning Blasey-Ford *worked* for republicans.  Kavanaugh was confirmed. 

That was a tactic to save Republicans from the embarrassment they faced during the Anita Hill hearing. 

And why would Democrats have brought in a lawyer to question Hill?  That doesn't make sense.  You do that if you think the person testifying might be lying.  Counsel is brought in by Senators who oppose the person testifying. 

What you're looking for is for the Democrats to have brought in a lawyer to question Thomas.  And that was unnecessary.  The lawyer did nothing to enhance the Kavanaugh hearing.  Democrats didn't need to hide behind anyone to question Thomas. 

You're literally just throwing bullshit at the wall to see what sticks and these attempts are so random that I have to keep your dumb theories consistent for you.  I don't see how this is easier for you than simply looking up the committee rules to back up your opinion.",0,1

AskReddit,"Took me a moment, but you're spot on. I think a lot of folks don't understand that upper middle class still means working for a living, actually earning your wages. Those who earn wages in the six figure range pay the highest overall taxes (even after accounting for FICA). They pay way, way more than the average uber rich person who gets their income through dividends or other capital gains and only pays 15% (less than half the less wealthy guy/woman who earns a wage). And that 15% is before tax deductions, and that is before carried-interest, Trump's developer tax breaks, etc.

With вЂњthis story sucksвЂќ youвЂ™re talking about this season? Or..? Because if it sucks then why are you here? I get that people complain about the OUT OF SOURCES last seasons (you said it yourself) but to call it Transformers 9 is just wrong. When I talk about Game of Thrones I think of it as whole, weвЂ™ve already seen political intrigue and cunning dialogues especially with characters such as LF, early Varys (when he mattered, he should be dead by now), TL, etc etc. Imagine 8 seasons of just that, betrayal after betrayal x100 or LittlefingerвЂ™s many accents. It would be boring. The action had to happen at some point. 

Also why do I get the feeling that youвЂ™re being passive aggressive with me? вЂњIf you were even watching thenвЂќ Dude I started my love for Game of Trones in the early 2000s. You can call me an idiot if you want, I certainly donвЂ™t believe that being happy because one of the stories you love is reaching itвЂ™s end should be labeled as being an idiot or happy because вЂњat least itвЂ™s somethingвЂќ.

They could have called the 911 caller back. They could have checked in house/ public records for the phone number. If it was a cell phone, they could have contacted the service provider and obtained subscriber information.

It gets busy sometimes and things can fall through the cracks, but given the nature of the call and the fact that two officers spent 30 minutes looking for the address I think more should have been done.

AskReddit,"It was almost Christmas.   My husband and I barely had two nickels to rub together.  I took my two small children grocery shopping,  and our car died in the parking lot.  I had no phone and no one I knew in town.

The kids and I walked six or eight blocks down the road to the local hospital.   I got the kids warmed up and they let me use their phone...but no one would give me a ride, not even the local cab service,  because my carseats were still in the broken-down car.

The lady at the front desk got ahold of a hospital volunteer.   This lady bought my kids a meal, took us home, and gave me a 20 as she left.

Awesome,  right?  But it gets better.

Did I mention how broke we were?  The kids were getting a few secondhand toys, but there was no money for presents.  This lady came back to our house, with bag after bag of stuff.  Groceries,  household necessities,  socks and gloves for the children...even nicely wrapped, new presents for the kids.  And a gas card for fifty bucks.

She had told me her husband had died recently,  and they had always done something nice for someone else around Christmas.   I still tear up thinking about it.",0,3

AskReddit,"Living room picnic. String some fairy (regular white Christmas lights) lights, drop some couch cushions &amp; pillows, cover it with a quilt, and call it good. Finger sandwiches are simple, pimento cheese spread, lunchmeat, cream cheese and olives, whatever kind you like. Over 21, bottle of cheap wine, under 21, empty wine bottle washed and filled with apple or grape cider. Potato salad if you like it, chips if you don't. Pie or cake for dessert, and voila!  Bonus points for doing it around sunset or midnight, watch the sunset or the stars while you eat and have nice cuddly time.

Walk on the beach. It's literally free. Grab buckets, collect shells or stones that you find along the way, then when you get home, do artsy things with them (the internet will be your inspiration, there are too many sea-gathered object art projects to list here).

Cook dinner together; spaghetti and garlic bread is a classic, and you don't have to be a 5 star chef to pull off something edible. Candles and nice china if you have it, or just more fairy lights and whatever regular dishes.

Go to the library, and each of you pick out a book for the other to read. Make a playlist of some of your favorite songs, and the  you'll have several dates- reading dates, then discussing both books dates.  Don't like to read? Pick a movie or TV series instead.",0,2

Not to mention you had the color issue with Kofi which made so many of us want to see him win the belt because black individuals rarely get the big belt. Natalya is another white blonde woman who already held the biggest belt.

 I know you didnвЂ™t directly imply they were similar by the way so IвЂ™m not trying to jump on you for your comment. Just stating why in my opinion it wouldnвЂ™t work.

marvelstudios,"Because the timeline he and Peggy were in could not affect the main timeline he came from, Cap could have done anything he liked and it would have not changed anything you saw.

He could have picked up another shield by going to Wakanda to pick up some more vibranium then have Howard Stark make him a new one to go fight in the Cold War and then end up at the bed side of the Steve Rogers they found in the ice to tell him all about Thanos and prevent that Universe from going through the snap. After which he gets Tony and Bruce to build a new device to get him back to the Main Timeline using the GPS he used to get there a week before he left. Then watching himself time travel out goes and sits on the bench with the shield he used from the other universe.

In fact this is the only way this could have happened. There was only a limited number of shields made, all of which were accounted for before the final battle. The one the old Cap gave had to have come some place else because he didn't take one with him into the past.

&amp;#x200B;

If not, and the battle at King's Landing is really all that is left, then it hardly seems like a fair fight. Bran will give just the right person exactly the right item/motivation they end up needing when they reach a pivotal moment.

&amp;#x200B;

I would totally be on board for Bran as the bad guy. It makes sense, really. He is not playing on the side of his family any more (maybe his perspective is even closer to that of the CotF), if he decides it would be better for all Starks, Lannisters and Targaryens to die, that's what he'll do.",0,2

First, Steve's shield broke apart in chunks, as opposed to the vision, where his shield is shown to be broken more or less in half.

But that's a minor detail, more importantly there are several parts of the vision that would've been impossible by that point of the movie. Natasha couldn't have been dead on the ground, because she was already dead on a distant planet in an alternate timeline. The Chitari wouldn't be flying away into a wormhole to reach Earth, because the battle took place on Earth, so they'd be flying towards Tony, not away.

And of course, if Tony hadn't stolen the Infinity Stones, everyone would've been dusted, (*everyone* including the Chitari) so that situation couldn't have happened, because nothing would happen, because there'd be nothing left to happen.

Most importantly Steve would never have said ""You could've saved us."" He wouldn't put the blame on Tony. If it was a real vision of a possible future he would've said something more along the lines of ""We could've done more.""",0,0

MortalKombat,"I'm starting to wonder if I am wasting my braincells on debating with you. Did your interest shift to semantics now? Are you a low-grade troll I fell for? You demand answers and arguments, but fail to acknowledge any of your conversation partners.

One last try.

When people discuss ""loot boxes"", they do so with the background of corporate greed and microtransactions. The 'loot boxes' in MK11 (yes, there are boxes of loot, albeit not fully random, but rather predetermined for all players, and simply location-swapped per player, thus everyone gets the same rewards) are not guarded behind microtransactions. Money cannot be used to attain them.

So yes, you could theoretically argue that they maintain the spirit of greedy evil corporations by providing players with a dopamine hit that could potentially be seen as exploitative, but again, real money is not involved in the attainment of these boxes, and whether or not people unlock them makes no monetary difference to the company.

YTA because it seems like you shamed your daughter for beginning to explore her sexuality, which is absolutely normal at her age, and which she was also doing with what she understood to be explicit permission from her mum. Also, isn't if better she starts to explore with toys on her own, than potentially putting herself in unsafe situations with other people?

However, I also think your wife is also the AH. She should have had this discussion and came to a consensus with you way before this even came up, so that when it came time to talk to your 12yo about it, you had a decision in place and could present a united front. There's always the possibility your daughter asked her not to, as she was embarrassed and felt more comfortable talking to her female parent about it.

politics,"Your vision of how a single payer system would work is very strange.

Today they get paid from United Healthcare. From Anthem. From Medicare. From Cigna. Single Payer just changes that to only Medicare.

Every doctor I know loves this - they have to hire a staff of sometimes dozens of people to do filing and contesting claims with insurance carriers, in addition to chasing accounts payable from patients. A single payer simplifies all of that. 

And just like Canada, England and Norway, doctors are not forced to take it. They can work as cash only doctors... few do, mind you. The same reason few doctors in America do that currently. Cash-only doctors typically service the ultra-wealthy, providing concierge medicine.

This system is neither hard nor oppression. It is replicated in every industrialized country on the face of the earth.",0,4

AmItheAsshole,"I have a close friend who struggled with alcoholism. Nicest guy youвЂ™ve ever met. When heвЂ™s drunk, he turns into a cocky abomination that you have to walk on eggshells around. He will continually not only talk about himself, but also seem unable to conceptualize anyone else as important. 

It took a long time, but I (and a group of our other friends) figured out how to affect his drunken behavior. We recorded how he acted when he was drunk. The self absorbed behavior of their drunken self will usually elicit guilt in their sober minds. They need to see for themselves what theyвЂ™re like while intoxicated. Social pressure will do the job for you as long as you arenвЂ™t directly confrontational. When given no enemies for defense mechanisms to target, the truth will eventually sink into the sober mind. Drunken actions follow sober thoughts, so they should slowly change.

Keep in mind this is just what worked for my situation; IвЂ™m not claiming itвЂ™s 100% foolproof.

Anyway, Best of luck.

What if I live in a middle class neighborhood- worked hard to move my family to a safer area - which costs more. Is it then right to move in a group of people who unfortunately turn to crime to either feed habits, or so they can eat. But then you also move in people with many mental health issues. Is the safety of the people who paid to live in a safer area because they could do so not worth anything?

Also Venezuela IS accepting aid from the UN and other nations. Just not the US since we have a history of not just giving humanitarian aid (Google Elliot Abrams). We burned those bridges and you can't be mad when someone sees it and says ""thanks but no thanks""

I understand we are all human, and we should all be treated like human beings, so I understand where you're coming from. But you have to realize that governments aren't individual people and the issue is way more complex then ""you're human so I'll fight for you since I'm human too"" since there are humans on BOTH sides, and not all them are wholly good or evil.",0,2

gameofthrones,"You're out of  your element.

What are the default settings of ""those TV's?"" There is no standard for the television hardware manufacturers, so using a reference monitor in the studio is required and editing/grading to a standard is required. The same is true in audio production.

The issues some people had with the episode were either due to compression caused by the CDN's distributing the content being overloaded and having to compensate with more compression, or people who have their TV's set up improperly (or some combination of both.)

Whether you are creating audio or video content, it's not the creator's job to set up your listening/viewing equipment properly. If a musical artist releases a song with experimental deep bass tones under 60Hz, and I have my equalizer set to not play sounds under 60Hz, is it the artist's fault? Should the artist restrict his creativity to account for bad speaker setup or my EQ preferences? It's all fine and dandy testing something on a decent car stereo system, but what about a car stereo that has the EQ set up in a funky way due to the user? How do you account for that? Adjusting it to match the improperly set up equipment will ruin it on other equipment.

The same applies to this episode. It was a battle fought in a blizzard in the middle of the night. If it were bright, it wouldn't be realistic or convey the mood that was intended. If people have set their TV to a high contrast mode that crushes highlights and lowlight details, that's not the creators fault. Saying it is, shows a rudimentary understanding of how the technology behind it all works.

No one said anything about being poor. You can use a shitty TV and as long as it is set up properly, you can see everything just fine. I've downloaded a copy of the episode, all details are within spec. per my testing. I have a shitty LED TV in my garage, and I can see everything just fine on the shitty TV, as well as my OLED TV, because both are calibrated correctly.

If you've gone back and viewed it on your TV again now that compression/distribution aren't as much of an issue, and you still can't see the details in the dark scenes, you'll be much more productive if you spent your time learning how to do a basic calibration on your TV, then complaining about how professionals who are at the top of their game (or else they wouldn't be working on the worlds most popular and anticipated show,) are bad at their job.",0,1

Parents buying vibrators for their 12 year old girl is a weird line to draw, surely there is an age where it would be inappropriate and if Reddit found out Daddy was buying his 8 year old daughter vibrators I'd be curious to see if they had the same opinion and also to see where the arbitrary line appeared.

You mean when Theon spent thirty seconds letting NK know exactly how he was going to attack and giving every chance for NK to counter? Nah, I didnвЂ™t miss that.

&gt;Or when a White Walker kicked Jon and he flew like 10 yards?

Yeah, and crossbow bolts can hurl someone backward five feet and pin them against a wall without any recoil on the shooter. ItвЂ™s a TV show, it looks cool.

None of these constitutes proof that itвЂ™s impossible to get the drop on a WW or the NK specifically. TheyвЂ™re strong and fast. So are like half the main characters. Like I said, weвЂ™ve seen them killed already.

&gt;Not to mention if you watch that scene again he holds her for a good second or two before she even drops the dagger. He had more than enough time to tear her apart he just inexplicably paused for dramatic effect because the plot demanded it.

WWs still take time to process information. Arya was ready and NK wasnвЂ™t. This is such a weird quibble. ItвЂ™s not like they locked eyes and screamed at each other for a half hour like a DBZ fight.

&gt;My point here is that the NK has a reputation. He nearly wiped out all of civilization in the past. I'm really supposed to believe no one could get the drop on him if it's this easy? That's what seems illogical to me.

At what point during the last 10,000 years or whatever did the NK expose himself enough that anyone could stab him? At what point was he ever so close to victory that he might be distracted enough to let his guard down? They even make a point of his hubris with all his little smirks.

&gt;He was built up since the first episode as a force of nature, something greater than the realms of men that would punish them for their petty squables over the Iron Throne. That has been repeated over and over and over again so many times it's impossible to miss. Instead of being that force of nature punishing a divided humanity he vanishes in one night against the first line of defense passed the Wall.

If heвЂ™s supposed to teach them the error of squabbling over thrones, thatвЂ™s pretty clearly your own prediction rather than anything explicitly said in the show. Sorry that didnвЂ™t pan out, but thatвЂ™s the issue with predictions I guess.

&gt;Really? Nedd Stark loses his head because he chose honor over saving his own neck. Robb Stark and his family are massacred because he did not honor his responsibilities as a Lord. Stannis has his army destroyed because he was too stubborn and lost his humanity in his lust for the throne and failed to see through Melisandre's lies, sacrificing the only thing that mattered to him and losing the faith of his men. Jon Snow fought for the greater good against tradition to help the Wildlings and paid the price of being massacred by his own men.

Who learned anything from this stuff? Seems like you just listed people who got killed because they didnвЂ™t learn shit.

&gt;Because I literally just said I also enjoyed the episode, I just found certain parts of it narratively unsatisfying.

She got laid off from her office job and was having a hard time finding work.
She applied and got a job as a mail carrier for USPS in the rural area where they live.

This was 80% walking and 20% driving.
Over three months she lost almost 50lbs just drinking water and walking almost 10miles a day.

This took her from 230 to 180, another three months and she was down to 150. 

Her husband however was almost 400lbs and had no stamina from what she was telling me.

He always told her he was too tired to help with the kids or to do anything really other than go to work (Sit behind a desk and do nothing after getting home) and relax.

She started getting more active since now she had more energy from being generally more healthy.
She did the shopping so she bought healthy foods that her husband didnвЂ™t like and was always complaining.
After about a year and then 3 months of counseling that went nowhere she filed for divorce.

She ended up spending alimony on surgery to remove excess skin from being overweight and making herself feel better about her body in the mirror. Nothing enhancing just nipping and tucking where weight loss and exercise wasnвЂ™t fixing like tummy flab, arm flab etc.

She tells me all the time if she never lost her job and didnвЂ™t become a mail carrier that she would have been content to stay with him, but after getting in shape she realized how bad and toxic he was for her.

She tried to make it work and encouraged him to be better for himself (She didnвЂ™t want to have kids with a fat lazy slob anymore and I donвЂ™t blame her) but he showed no ambition or will to change.

That's not a bad thing, but I don't think these books are *currently* contributing anything to literature moreso than the other major fantasy series out there.  I think Martin *has* helped some people get back into reading, which is a special accomplishment IMO.  

The lore and complexity is what makes them exceptional, but Martin is really struggling with that complexity. What makes them great is probably also what will make them unfinished, and I have a hard time putting unfinished work on a pedestal.  

If he manages to finish the series or delegates someone who can, and the books are well done (i.e., wrapped up the dozens of plots well, and better in quality than the last two books), then he'll definitely have an argument for a top 3 fantasy series, and perhaps the most culturally significant one since LOTR.",0,3

My question is this, when he is sent back in time to put the stones back, how does he get to the real timeline to do so? The devices they have lets you go past in your timeline and start a new branch. Nowhere did they discuss labeling and going to specific branches. I suspect he went back and attempted to put stuff back in place, to only end up leaving two of each stone, not that it matters. I just dont get how he can come back to timeline a as old, because again he has no way to select a specific branch. Only way to come back to your branch is to use the main quantum machine, which bounces you back to your 'home'.

dankmemes,"Has society really become so debased in recent times that we signal our respect to others by typing ""F""? How pathetic. That to me doesn't show respect at all, it shows complete lunacy and laziness. I angry react every comment I see with just an F. I do feel that this is part of a wider phenomenon where people don't really understand how to show genuine gratitude and sincere feelings anymore. Essentially, we are more inclined to take people for granted to the extent that we would rather press a single letter on a keyboard to acknowledge what someone has done or said, rather than take some time out to explain why we are grateful. It's ridiculous and this practice should be stopped immediately. No surprises that this practice originates from an internet game - ""Call of Duty"", where people literally press F for respects. I think this sums up everything succinctly. I don't expect basement-dwellers jacking off furiously whilst simultaneously shooting down grandmas and hoes to know the definition of respect. It is important to show our appreciation for others. Stop being a douchebag and ""pressing F"". It annoys the hell out of me, and I'm sure people look down on you for engaging in such a practice. I know I certainly get the impression of you acting like that bobbing duck toy (as shown). Are you a reasonable human being or a bobbing duck toy? Ask yourself that.

AmItheAsshole,"NTA, and OP I have to warn you to be very careful here with who might find out about this. 

Whether or not it's fair, some people would consider this concerning enough to contact CPS. I work with children and teens and have attended numerous seminars (edit: seminars about what to look for concerning possible abuse and neglect) and one of the things we're told to look out for is children participating in sexual behavior that is too mature for them. 

Everyone here is saying ""but 12 year olds masturbate"" and that is absolutely true. Children often begin to do so as young as 5. That's not the issue here, and hearing that a preteen was masturbating shouldn't raise red flags for anyone. Hearing that a 12-year-old has been given a SEX TOY by her PARENTS would ABSOLUTELY raise red flags for many people. It is not normal for her age, puberty or no she emotionally she is still a child.

Again, I'm not saying it's necessarily fair to you. I'm sure I'll get downvoted to oblivion just for mentioning this. But it had to be said, I really just want you to be aware that this could be a potential issue.",0,0

The problem is that rather than approach your girlfriend from a place of empathy, you've used harsh and cruel language that is naturally going to put her on the defensive. You are the ass for that. *However* I understand what you are trying to accomplish. You did so in a very poorly thought out way, and rather than use your words to try to fix the problem, you decided to throw money at her to fix it. That's not a solution.

soccer,"**""I had two bottles of wine, I broke one in the head of one guy and I ran away""**, explains the protagonist of The Lord of the Rings

&amp;#x200B;

The popular and much loved character of the Lord of the Rings, Aragorn, played by Viggo Mortensen, would surely have faced them sword in hand. But the actor, the real person, has been more cautious. The fact is that the Argentine actor, who has never hidden his passion for football and more specifically for the San Lorenzo de Almagro, to the point that he took a pin from his club during the last Oscars Awards, has explained how he escaped a dangerous brawl with ultras from Real Madrid.

The radical fans attacked him thinking he was a Barcelona fan. It happened in 2006 when Viggo Mortensen, who was immersed in the shooting of Captain Alatriste's film, was mistaken for a BarГ§a supporter.

The actor decided to tell the anecdote 13 years later. It was the day in which his team lost 1-7 against Boca, a match he saw in Madrid with director AgustГ­n DГ­az Yanes. The director invited him to dinner at his house, preparing for the occasion. ""I took flags, shirts, hats, scarves ... Then they make us a goal, two goals, three goals ... I sank in the armchair"", reveals in radio 'Vorterix'.

However, the worst came after the game. ""I was in the Puerta del Sol, the ultras saw the colors of my clothing and thought i was a BarГ§a supporter. Those bald guys started to say ugly things and hitting me. I had two bottles of wine, I broke one in the head of one and I ran away. ""

When arriving at the house of AgustГ­n DГ­az Yanes, the director asked him if it was blood what he wore on his shirt. Not to worry his friend, he said no, that it was wine.",0,89

CO2 spikes have happened before in Earth's geological historyвЂ¦ but there hasn't been a natural reason for THIS spikeвЂ¦ and it's quite a fucking massive spike. So when you break it down it looks like this:

- We know that CO2 warms the planet.
- We know that CO2 can be released in massive quantities naturally because that's happened before.
- We know that such a massive natural release hasn't happened recently.
- We know that a massive man-made release has been happening constantly for the last century+
- We can see from records and ice sampling that the recent CO2 releases are very significant.
- When you add all that up, **we are the volcano.**

This is also very basic logic.

Some people like to argue that the amount we release is small compared to massive volcanoes, which is true, but it's also CONSTANT. We're doing it 24/7 for over a hundred years and we're doing more and more every day. Over time this adds up to something which should concern everyone.",0,4

AskReddit,"""let's do it""

This man about 65-70 came in. He was old but not super old. A lot of good life left in him. 

Was in town visiting when he started coughing up blood. His aorta was about to burst. It was bad. His wife was there with him the whole time. 

We counseled him on the options. The highest risk surgery you could imagine. That's what he faced. Choose that or choose dying in 3-5 days by coughing up and choking and stifling on your blood as it drowns and suffocates you as you gasp for air while your aorta pumps blood out of your mouth. 

I think he knew. He had a thousand yard stare the whole time he was in the ICU. Stoic. He hadn't accepted death. But he had accepted his circumstances. 

He decided to opt for surgery. 

He made it through surgery. But never woke up. Made it back to the unit intubated. And just couldn't pull through from the procedure. Just took too much from him. 

I just always put myself in his shoes. To try and understand how I would feel. 

I practically know I will die from surgery. I know I will not wake up. I am actively making this decision to try, but chances are slim. I'm not telling a man to hold a gun to my head and kill me.... But the outcome is the same.... Right? All that is different is I get wheeled to a room and get some Ativan to calm my nerves and in a consciousless state for a day or two until I pass. 

I think of how he mentally prepared himself. Did he sleep the night before? Would I cry like a baby being wheeled to the OR, Backing out at the last minute to spend a futile few extra hours with my wife? His wife sat by his side for those two days waiting for him to wake up.

unpopularopinion,"I thought Jyn's motivation was established well enough with her father's death.  She saw the Empire take her father and kill her mother. It was a supremely powerful force imposed on her world while her childhood heroes (parents) could do nothing against it. Her adoptive father fought the Empire, but he devolved into impotent madness and abandoned her. As far as Jyn is concerned, the Empire is invincible while the Rebels are pathetically delusional.

Then the turn. Her father is alive. Not only alive but still resisting. He was never beaten by the Empire, he was playing the long game. He was avenging Jyn's mother and pulling the wool over the man who broke up their family. And he needs Jyn's help. She rushes to help her father, but all she can salvage is his mission and dying wish. She's not an angsty pessimist anymore; she's a child desperate to keep her family's legacy going. Desperate to cling to this last spark of hope and to punish the Empire in a meaningful way.

Jyn doesn't really care about the Rebellion's members or their politics, only in the shared goal of hurting the Empire. Her speech feels forced because it kinda is. She isn't sold on the Rebellion so much as on her Father's specific plan. In a way, she's a very human character for this.",0,1

news,"Following the Christchurch shooting and the news that NZ would be changing it's gun laws, I commented how glad I was and I ended up getting some pretty alarming messages from pro-gun American's (based on post history) who genuinely believe that having a gun on you means you'll instantly diffuse the situation and save everyones lives.

**Edit:** Since some people seem to take issue with this view, I should have put a disclaimer saying I am from New Zealand. I'd also like to say that the alarming messages included death threats so ya know, not exactly looking too favourable on that topic currently.

To answer one of the most debated things here, you can look at the use of guns in two ways: They act as a deterrent, or they escalate.

If we take the first road, owning guns act as a deterrent because the threat of harm will prevent offensive action being taken. This is the exact same view that some countries have towards nuclear weapons and is equally a contentious topic. Your neighbour owns a gun, so therefore you are less likely to burgle him because he might shoot you, right?

But what if you too had a gun, and you bring it with you? Now you've got two offensive weapons and an incredibly dangerous situation. This is a likely outcome if you are legally allowed to own them.

The second road is what lead to the Cuba Missile Crisis and, shockingly, the reason that it was deescalated was through diplomacy and the removal of the Jupiter missiles from Turkey (and debatably Italy too). The fact that the US had a vastly superior arsenal did not factor into either sides decision-making process.

The removal of the weapons (guns if we drop the analogy) lead to a de-escalation of tensions. The likelihood of someone shooting you is dramatically decreased if guns are illegal or far more tightly regulated. Yes, there will be cases where one person has a gun and the other is unarmed and dies as a result, but those are the outliers and are such a minuscule amount of cases.",1,-3

Edit: AAANd with genital it is not that linear. Herpes gets more common with age since they have simply had more sexual exposures. And also women get infected more easily. So mid 30 women will have the biggest part of that 1 in 5. Teen males the smallest part etc.

We could say the same thing for Japan for instance. Largely a homogenous population.

We (USA) have a large melting pot of a population, and as such have widely different demands of our healthcare system. It's much easier to prepare and maintain treatments for people with similar genetic backgrounds. Same for generally unified cultures. Most likely due to dietary and environmental factors. The same cannot be said for the US. It's too big, too different, and generally not very efficiently managed in a centralized manner.

We do have a strong economy and abundant resources. Is it strongly enough to scale and support unified healthcare for our diverse population? I have a tendency to think it will balloon out of control and will not work. Costs will be astronomical, much more so than projections. I mean look at our VA system. This should be the shining example of what socialized healthcare should be in the US. We should be taking care of our soldiers, but the VA is generally trash. Veterans healthcare outcomes suck. I mean if you can't trust them to take care of those who gave all, can you trust them to take care of those who have nothing? I have no faith in that system.

It's also proven we aren't smart enough to manage our money responsibly. Take a look at any government ledger. Further adding to it being more infeasible.

I get that you think socialized healthcare is some magic bullet, but it isn't. The argument was more Norway has just about perfect conditions to pull this off, and even then it still has issues. I don't think the US could effectively pull it off and the conditions to do it aren't really there. Can it be better than it is? Certainly.",0,3

nba,"Every once in while I get the urge to chime in on one of these anti-CP3 threads to tell this story and ask for help tracking down this segment:

Several years ago (pre-2014), I believe it was on Zach Lowe's podcast, a sportswriter (I want to say Arnovitz, but I'm not sure) relayed a story about interviewing CP3 where he got into a tense back-and-forth with CP around a series of 'spirit of the rule' type questions where he was asking him about whether or not he thought flopping, grabbing arms, and otherwise trying to do 'illegal' things on the court was 'moral' or within 'the spirit of the game/rule' and the sportswriter got really frustrated because CP was pretending to not understand the concept and conflating 'getting caught' with 'doing wrong'. Essentially, CP seems to believe that what makes a thing 'bad' is whether or not you are caught doing it. 

You can understand so much of CP's career in light of this comment. From the punching of dicks, the flopping, his routine excessive contact, etc. all of the things people dislike about CP are summed up in that exchange. He's an immoral, dirty basketball player that most importantly **should not be president of the NBA players' union** because he routinely shows little to no respect for his colleagues, as evidenced by his on court behavior.",0,272

re: 1

Abolition of the gold standard was a failure of the government because it failed to play by  its own rules which were agreed during the Bretton Woods conference. The government agreed to maintain a ratio but instead inflated unsustainably, created diplomatic crises when other countries wanted to reclaim their gold reserves over the overleveraged money supply and ultimately reneged on the deal by closing the ""gold window"". 

-------------


re: 2 

Crypto-currencies do not function as money yet because they do not have established markets and are currently used as speculative instruments.  Money needs markets. Without markets nothing can be money. This is why governments when creating legal tender make it a tool for paying taxes and other legal debts thus *forcing* a creation of the markets.

The fact that governments do whatever they can to fight them - because at this stage crypto prevents government control of money supply - is also important, but it's also a fact that crypto is in its infancy. Markets develop over time. You can develop markets for precious metals and you can develop markets for cigarettes.  To state ""it's not money"" without qualifiers is a sign of ignorance.


-----------------------


re: 3

Central banks do nothing but continue with rampant inflation of the money supply. It's just being coordinated so relative inflation remains low but if you wonder where the sudden spikes in prices of certain goods like education, healthcare or housing comes from... all from inflation being re-directed into those markets.

What is relative inflation? Well since all currencies are free-floating and their value depends on supply and demand you can hide inflation by forcing all emitters of money to inflate at an agreed-upon rate. This leads to lack of capital flight between currencies and limits the amount of inflation that can be seen by the depreciation of currency vs other currencies. But the cost of living vs income continues to widen over long term.

Also to understand relative inflation check the exchange rate for Swiss Franc during the Euro crisis around 2013 or so. Swiss Franc shot into the sky and the Swiss central bank was forced to expand money supply massively to prevent death by strangulation with overvaluation of the Franc vs Euro, Dollar and Pound.

re: 4

Most of ""genius economists"" are not genius ""economists"". Friedman was a poor economist, as was Keynes, as was Krugman, as was Stiglitz. Most of those people were known for their political economy as well and creating policy prescriptions and rationalizations rather than developing methodology, models and providing new insights. 

The real  ""genius economists"" were often non-economists, like Nash because real economics is boring. Opinions on why you getting the money is right and ignorant moralizing on the other hand - which is what you do - is soo very popular.

Also Hayek's prize came for re-formulation of the theory of the business cycle which while not his own is the only attempt at correct explanation of the purely economic dimension of the business cycle. Keynes talks about animal instincts which explains motivation but not why markets magically find mountains of money to speculate with. Hayek explained it - as well as how the booms form and how they are ultimately always doomed to fail. He also explained that it is not the bust but the boom which is the ""Bad"" part and bust simply re-sets the economy to a healthy equilibrium. That it costs businesses, jobs and savings is the fault of the boom and not the correction.

No other widely recognized economist did that since most want to get paid by government institutions so they say the politically correct line - the one you are repeating - which is economically wrong but politically correct. And that is apparently more important. Bad economics is good economics when it is good for politicians.


--------------------------


re: 5

Considering that the alternative in Chile and Portugal was a communist revolution... yes he did care about *relative* freedom. He was also an economist so he focused on real alternatives and economic freedom, not imaginary freedoms that leftist authoritarians proclaim as they take over and monopolize entire economies and then proceed to steal resources that ""belong to the people"" at a much greater rate than the worst capitalist.

Hayek also criticized the western capitalist model and was far more lenient toward certain government programs (although not toward their efficiency or the real motivation behind them) than for example Friedman.

worldnews,"&gt; The constitution does not support Guaido as ruler. It would only support him in the case of an illegitimate election as a temporary president to set up a NEW election.

Which they had an illegitimate election.  After the opposition won a super majority, Maduro and his allies stripped the national assembly of all power, and created a constituent national assembly.  The new Constituent national assembly maduro created made new last minute rules to running in the election, those rules barred a lot of opposition from running.  This was also why they protested and view the election as illegitimate, because they don't recognize the power of the constituent assembly.

&gt;Guaido did not even run in the last election, nobody voted for him president. That isn't democracy.

Guaido represents the National Assembly, the oppositon won a super majority in the national assembly through democratic elections.  This is democracy.

Stripping the national assembly of all power because he lost support in it, is not democracy.",0,4

relationship_advice,"&gt;I broke up with my first love and died inside for quite some time.  The biggest killer of relationships is expectations.   We set high standards usually that will never be fully met.  

This has everything to do with shame and [fear of vulnerability.](https://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_on_vulnerability/transcript?language=en)

People set unrealistic expectations because they are ashamed of themselves. This is a way of setting up a situation so that our most cogent fears come to life. That is, shifting the goalposts for ourselves and others until we feel our fears will be validated. This, instead of focusing on what we need from a person *Right Now.* Shame says that what we need right now isn't valid.

People with feelings of shame often deal with it by trying to make *uncertain* things into what they believe as certainties. Such as, a person's interest and love in the future.",0,1

With that said, at that age I (I was born female and identify as female) played on a boys football team. I was the best and strongest player on that team by a long shot. Kids at that age regardless of gender are very similar and in fact males mature less quickly, i was slightly bigger than my teammates at the time but I was also a good athlete and had been playing many sports my whole life. BГ©a being a good player probably has little to do with the fact that sheвЂ™s a m to f transgender person. I would not bring the fact that her team tends to win up, i just donвЂ™t really think itвЂ™s relevant. She may just be talented. Also, keep in mind that children can be prejudice towards people who they perceive as different from them. Not to say that your kid is, but just to keep that in mind too and be sure to hear what BГ©a and her parents have to say. ThereвЂ™s a good chance Bea experiences bullying in some capacity and she may be acting out. Be gentle with the situation, but the school and her parents need to make sure sheвЂ™s well behaved. Maybe teachers go easier on her because of the fact that sheвЂ™s trans, which clearly is of no benefit to her or anybody else.

AmItheAsshole,"NAH, however, you could be NTA depending on the buyers intentions .

A recent eBay anecdote. I recently sold a pair of brand new in the box shoes on eBay with pictures of the size of the shoes(on the tongue and on the box). Someone purchased the shoes, received them and then messaged me that the shoes didn't fit and they must have been men's size X and not women's size X(they weren't). I offered a refund if she sent the shoes back in the condition she received them(at this point she hadn't gone through the official eBay returns procedure). She sent back the original box I sent her, with the original shoebox inside that box with all the packing materials, and no shoes. Empty box. Then messaged me a bunch asking where her refund was, and that the shoes were in the box, etc. etc. I basically told her she knew damn well she shipped me an empty box.  She contacted eBay and requested a refund and that they look at the case, and then they issued her a refund from my PayPal. I had to get eBay involved and they looked through our message history and then they refunded me back the money and I reported her(always use eBay messenger!). It was a major pain in the ass, and eBay almost always sides with the buyer. You also can't leave bad feedback for a buyer, so you'll never know if someone buying your stuff has pulled this shit before. I'm guessing she tried to pull something like this before since they quickly refunded my cash. Now every auction I do is a no returns auction. 

TL;DR Lady returns empty box, still tries to get money, eBay gives it to her, then gives it back to me, probably because she's done this before.",0,3

asoiaf," 

Imagine  the following climactic sequence. Obviously the events leading to it  would be different than the ones we've seen in the actual episode , but  humor me.

""Daenerys,  Jorah and Jon are surrounded by the Whitewalkers in the Godswood. Jorah  is mortally wounded, gasping for his last breaths in the arms of his  queen. Jon draws his sword and prepares for the onslaught. As the  Whitewalkers rush the trio, Daenerys sees something in the sky above  them. She hesitates for a moment but as Jon is overwhelmed by the  frenzied enemies, she grips Jorah tighter and screams at the top of her  lungs. вЂњDrakkarys!вЂќ. Two massive plumes of fire bathe the ground where  our heroes and the horde of Whitewalkers occupy. The Night King turns  his sight from Bran to witness the fire. What a moment ago was a swirl  of cloth and iron and undead flesh and bone is now a pile of drifting  ashes, with the exception of two figures that still linger in the  cinders.

Looking up from her hands that  now hold charcoal dust, Daenerys sees a bewildered, unscathed, unburned  Jon. She now knows that his words were true. And Jon himself fully  realizes for the first time that same truth as his eyes meet the  surprised gaze of the Night King. вЂњAzor AhaiвЂќ, Mellisandre whispers  under her breath. A faint smile forms in Bran's face. With his blade  still glowing red from the dragonfire baptism and his scorched armor  that makes the cold rain hiss as it touches it, a reassured Aegon  Targaryen hurls with fury towards the Frozen Lord.

Steel  clashes as the two make contact. As the fight goes on, Jon realizes  that fury and righteousness alone are no match to the old magic of his  foe. The Night King is better than him. ""Far Better"". Thrown to the  ground after a failed attack, the northman feels desperation clutching  him into its icy claws. Towering over him ready to deliver the final  blow, the Night King's eyes catch a glimpse of a shadow just out of  sight. There's something there. Someone. Noone.""

I want to know what it will be like when we first get off this rock and colonize another planet. I want to see another star system. I want to be there when we cure disease, figure out abundant clean energy, and when we accidentally create life that is much more intelligent than we are.

relationship_advice,"I would say the latest is at whatever point I would start considering it cheating. If you're dating non-exclusively and can still fuck others, it's not *necessary* to bring it up right away. If you *only* date exclusively, I'd bring it up immediately. I think it'd be best to bring it up as early as possible since it might be a deal breaker for some people, but I have to imagine that people who consider porn cheating don't date non-exclusively for long, if at all. 

It's hard for me to say though, since as I mentioned I'm not the one that feels that way, and I'm a heavy communicator. It's basically my love-language. So if I didn't feel comfortable talking about it with someone, I'd probably already be incompatible with them. Plus I'm married, so it's quite a non-issue these days.

But talking about our beliefs and why we have them is one of the first things I do when bonding with someone. So it would come up naturally for me very quickly.

And I thought it was great that he just instantly spins around and grabs her not only by the neck but the dagger hand at the same time. If we are to believe that she is so fast and sneaky that she can just waltz on past white walkers while SPRINTING AT FULL SPEED, and the nighking says ""nope, that's not gonna work on me"" you just expect me to believe he's going to stand there and just stare at her? he's clearly stronger/smarter/faster than any ONE person alone. shit was lame as fuck arya should be dead just from him grabbing and crushing her throat with a subzero degree ice grip.

There is no reason why a broken tail light and potential ignorance of fines should result in not being allowed to vote.

This shit can be abused and we can find things that are ""wrong"" with people we don't like. Races we don't like. Jail them, and because they are jailed, strip away their voting rights. These criminals are US citizens, whether you like it or not, and I'm pretty sure that they, too, want to better the country they live in.

To think that we are the only world out of the whole vastness of the universe is, to me, narcissistic in the extreme.

Edit: I forgot to add that life and life intelligent enough to talk between solar systems are 2 very different concepts.

I have no doubt that life exists on other worlds, however considering the vastness of space and how short our own history is, it is entirely possible that a species could rise and fall with out ever meeting an alien. It's a sad thought, but one that was backed by some compelling information.

Edit 2: also, the whole of scientific investigation is making a hypothesis and then going about proving it wrong or right. Hawkins had a bunker built in a mountain to find out if dark matter was real. My point is, often in order to get proof you need to believe the proof exists before hand",0,1

Giving your opponent complete control is the worst possible thing. I'm pretty sure the forces of the living *only* needed to trade about 10 to 1 in order to win this fight, maybe like 15:1 if you include recently dead that become raised to fight for the dead. Now 10/15 to 1 isn't exactly ideal, but it isn't exactly unprecedented either for a defending force to achieve this with superior tactics, defenders advantage and high level execution. I'd much rather destroy his whole army and possibly risk his escape (although dragons are probably pretty good at catching runaways) than sacrificing the vast, vast , majority of my forces and HOPING I can predict what an undead being does when he's already killed everybody I know and care about.

&gt; being able to think and feel about those experiences is a passive feminine aspect, 

Except that thinking and feeling aren't passive, they're active. Perhaps you might consider the concept of neutral.

Still ignores reaction/feminine.

Your hypothesis is one of the better I've heard, but I'm not sure that avenue is worth more time to develop.

AskReddit,"My husband and I were driving from New Jersey to Georgia in March of 2015. It was about a 15 hour drive and we were about 13 and a half hours into it. The drive was pretty much a straight shot on the same highway, I-95.

It was about 1am and weвЂ™d planned to push through so we could get to the hotel by 3am and at least sleep in a bed instead of the truck. My husband was driving since IвЂ™d not had much experience driving his truck, but he was starting to get tired and IвЂ™d offered to drive since he was fading. 

Suddenly, we come upon this stretch of Highway that was by far the creepiest, most intense thing IвЂ™ve ever seen. The north bound side (other side) of the highway, on a desolate stretch of road, had been completely shut down in both directions. Huge, football-field style spot lights were set up and illuminating the bone chilling scene below. There was an over-turned, burned up tractor trailer, lay across the highway. There were 6-7 completely annihilated, burned up cars - or they couldвЂ™ve been trucks or SUVs. There was no telling. 

There was soot, blood, sawdust, and some kind of dark fluid all over the road. Surrounding the scene were parked, turned off emergency vehicles. Probably 30 different cars/fire trucks/ambulances/etc., all sitting around the perimeter of the carnage. The scene, though so brightly illuminated we thought we were on a movie set, was completely deserted and silent. No people. No emergency lights. Just a brightly lit horrifying and completely abandoned wreckage site. 

We were somewhere in South Carolina. I think the town was called Florence. 

Found out later that there was a horrible fatal wreck in which a whole family died around 7pm the night before, and theyвЂ™d just left the entire miles-long stretch of highway closed for hours because clean up had been too much to handle that night. 


That woke us both up to the point of primal fear. I had never seen such a horrible wreckage in my life, my hands were shaking. My husband white knuckled it the final two hours, barely breathing. We both swore we kept seeing figures in the shadows of the shoulder the rest of the drive.",0,3
apexlegends,"Honest answer, yes it has actually. I have won 8 season 1 games with a total kill count of 54 because what me and my friends usually do is grab guns that we're comfortable in using and then wait for the other teams to take each-other out while waiting for the last 2 squads to battle and as soon as it turns to 2 squads left, we engage and usually get em while they're injured.

worldnews,"Properly cared for, wood buildings can last for centuries.. new forms of plywood construction are allowing larger and larger wood structures. Trees can also live for thousands of years before they die... I am all about high tech solutions where lower tech ones will not work... but we seriously need to educate engineers, architects, city planners and other professionals about basic biological principals. One of my favorite examples is scaffolding... bamboo is so much better than steel, and while it will release that carbon it holds once it decomposes.. that carbon was in the air a few decades  before. Where as producing steel is all carbon that has been locked away for thousands of years. 
Also the idea that all of the carbon is stored away in plant tissue above ground is incorrect. 50-70 percent of carbon at least in boreal ecosystems is present in tree roots and their associated fungi.. these fungi are often the decomposers of leaf litter and twigs.. however fungal tissue is mostly carbon as well. so much of the carbon stored in plants ends up stored in the soils, fungi. In trees like redwoods those root systems often outlive what we think of as trees. 
Just a few thoughts.. but hey we should be attempting lots of different solutions . and im not an expert on carbon capture by any means. i also recognize that planting trees alone will not be enough..",0,1

Most married couples, especially with 12 year old children, should know each other well enough to know where they'd stand on this kind of thing. That being said, the feminists commenting of course exaggerate that you just basically did the worst thing in the world. I'm not going to go into my deep and nuanced views on why SOME sexual repression is a good thing, but in short it's what was required for society's to protect their women and therefore their continued existence. Feminism was needed before because it liberated women from traditions and roles that became obsolete with our society's advancement and development.

AskReddit,"My son saying weird stuff while having fever dreams/delusions.  He had fevers a lot because he had chronic ear infections until we were able to have ear tube put in surgically.  He had just turned 2 at the time, but when he had a fever he suddenly said things that were much above his typical verbal and intellectual level.  Like counting to 20 or saying the full alphabet correctly.  Or really just speaking in full correct sentences in general, though they didnвЂ™t really make sense logically.

leagueoflegends,"People who main champs that get virtually no skins have pretty much a 0% chance for getting that skin if riot is only thinking about cash grab skins. 

&amp;#x200B;

We make as much noise as we can even if we don't like making noise or even if we ourselves think it's ridiculous for us to ask for anything beyond the ""cash grab"" skins because if we don't try and pressure riot to do something, they'll default down the path of what makes the easiest money for them. We know that getting more lux, ezreal, ahri, etc skins is inevitable and getting virtually 0 skins for some other champs is going to happen but making lots of noise and trying to pressure riot via this noise on social media raises our chances from 0% to 0.5% of them making a skin for our favorite champs. 

&amp;#x200B;

On a completely separate note, there must be some people who work on the skin team at riot who are sick of making skins for the same champs over and over again. There are probably people there who want to explore some unique ideas for other champs but the people at the top of the totem pole won't let them since the income won't be as high from them.",0,-2

One that I met when I was 17 was basically what you'd be afraid of with someone much older, but that was an exception. I think it just really depends on what everyone expects and how much care and respect there is in the relationship. 

The problems with these relationships are that much of the time someone is in it for the wrong reasons, and (generally) the younger person gets abused or railroaded. 

As a close friend, you don't have to use the general rule of thumb, you can just watch and notice if something is wonky. If you see actual problems with how your friend is treating her, or how her expectations are forming or whatever, then talk to him about that when that happens.

The fact that only 17% of women reported using vibrators before the age of 20 could quite possibly be due to access more than choice or interest... many of us used alternative methods and objects because of the lack of availability or the associated shame or stigma. Also your ""logical"" assumption has no basis in logic at all- there's no reason to assume females dont masturbate until they're 17+.

gameofthrones,"&gt;They send their cavalry

The Dothraki weren't cavalry. The Valemen were cavalry. The way they blasted into Ramsay Bolton's flank at the Battle of the Bastards was the way cavalry works. 

The Dothraki are mounted archers. They aren't armed for cavalry charges. They're supposed to stay in bowshot but out of reach of the enemy. And just keep shooting arrows, killing as many as possible from a distance. Once they fall back to the trench line, set the trenches on fire with the Unsullied BEHIND the trenches, and the Dothraki behind the Unsullied to kill any wights that get through. They can still shoot from the rear of the front line.

Really, sending a cavalry charge into that mass was just stupid. And wasteful. I haven't seen season 8 yet, but whoever planned this shouldn't be in charge of armies. If it was Danaerys, it was hubris. The battle plan I've seen described, with the Unsullied in front of the trench line, just doesn't make sense.",0,1

Throwaway. 

I've been a nurse for a few years now. My friend works in a cafeteria of a hospital and encouraged me to apply there. I figured it could be nice because I wanted a job in the city and the trauma unit had an opening. 

After about three months I decided to quit. It was one of the most poorly run units I have ever seen. I got a new job pretty quickly and told my friend we could still hang out often because I ended up staying in the city. 

My friend blew up on me and said I need to give her $1,000. It turns out she filled out a referral form at the hospital when I applied. They were short on nurses and were offering $1,000 to anyone who referred one and were subsequently hired. I received a $1,000 sign on bonus as well when I got hired. I didn't think anything of it because that's common for nurses in this area. I manage my money well though and will just be paying back the bonus. I didn't even know my friend was getting a bonus. I didn't even know she filled out a form about me. The fine print says she also has to pay back a bonus since I didn't stay on board for a year. Again, I knew nothing about her getting a bonus.

She said she doesn't have the money to pay it back and I need to give her the money. She told me I needed to stop being a greedy bitch. I told her she can return her fancy $800 iPad to cover it if I'm such a bitch then. It's funny because I remember wondering how she could afford an iPad Pro when she's strapped for cash all the time. Guess I figured out how that happened.

вЂњThe 3ER was in a cave with a man, boy, girl, wolf, and a few Children of the Forest. He's now up against an army who have the knowledge and proven capacity to kill his kind.вЂќ

    Except by that point he had defeated most of the living and had resurrected new ones hence his over confidence that they had won the fight.


вЂњHe wasn't a military genius but his strategy of ""overwhelm with wights"" had always worked and now he decided ""Well, since I'm already here anyways.....""

      They did the same when he attacked the cave. Overwhelmed them and went in for the kill himself.  Which is why I donвЂ™t understand your point he did it before so why doesnвЂ™t it make sense that he did it now. 

вЂњExcept for the duality of the NK somehow being a force of nature and being prone to making the mistakes of a man. There's also the really dumb military tactics from the human side and I better not here ""it makes good tv"" because good tv can still have bad writing.вЂќ 

Except the NK used to be a human man. That was given the supernatural abilities that he has but his mind was human once so being surprised that underneath all that ice is a human mind doesnвЂ™t make sense . He arranged symbols in snow and on walls to send messages he showed off for Jon Snow twice a force of nature wouldnвЂ™t do that but he wasnвЂ™t a force of nature that is just your interpretation he was a man bent on the goal he was created for to destroy the living.

AskReddit,"My friend's sister is very irresponsible and lazy. She made the irresponsible decision of having 3 kids in 3 years even though she wasn't financially stable at all. The reason she's not financially stable is because she's too lazy to keep a job (even now that she has kids to feed). She'll get jobs, but during the first few months she gets fired for not showing up. Her kids have a roof over their head and food and everything, but they always look like they need a bath, and they don't get much attention or mental stimulation, so they're developmentally behind. Plus her house is always DISGUSTING because she's too lazy to clean it, like there's bugs and shit in there. But she drops the kids off at her grandparents' house a lot, and they at least get decently taken care of there.

The thing that makes me sad for her is that she steals money from her grandparents to make ends meet (instead of just showing up to work like a decent person). Not a lot of money at once, but like $20 here, $40 there. She's not on drugs or anything. She's just that lazy because she's never had to work for anything in her life. Her grandparents could call the cops on her for stealing (because she's stolen credit cards and stuff from them and in total has stolen over $10,000). And her grandparents aren't rich, they're like middle class, so this has affected them financially. But they don't call the cops because they know if authorities get involved, they'll take the kids away, and they've become really attached to the kids since they take care of them half the time. So they just turn a blind eye to it, and she keeps doing it because she knows she'll get away with it. Obviously, in this situation I am much more sad for her kids (and for her grandparents) than I am for her, but still. What kind of pathetic person steals money from their grandparents? That's a sad life.",0,2

Instead he pushed for too much - he would never be able to win given both the tyrells and lannisters, and the crownlands were all against him and the riverlands. The tyrells and lannisters have the most money and troops by far.

AmItheAsshole,"^^^^AUTOMOD  ***The following is a copy of the above post. This comment is a record of the above post as it was originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***

The other day I had a chat with a friend that I haven't talked to in 4 months. I'd been wondering why but not really thought much of it. The chat was linking memes and laughing at them but then my friend had something to tell me. He told me why we hadn't talked.

&amp;#x200B;

Last new yearвЂ™s I had a small get together with three friends and me. It was nothing big, mostly just us hanging out, playing video games and drinking while waiting for midnight. This guy was one of the guests.

&amp;#x200B;

Back to the conversation. He started listing reasons why he hadn't had the guts to write to me. One point being that he disliked my rats and them being out on my couch. He knew before he came that I have rats.

&amp;#x200B;

This friend decided to tell me that he was disgusted because he had to sleep there and suddenly it wasn't one rat turd that he complained about, it was all my rats AND my bunny pissing and pooping all over the couch. He kept coming up with new excuses when I called him out and telling me about diagnoses, IвЂ™d never heard of before, as a base for his explanations. Another thing; I did offer my friends blankets and covers for the night. My friend straight up said no and that it was all okay. Fair enough, I thought and went to bed.

&amp;#x200B;

Then he tells me that his excuse for saying no was that his anxiety had been triggering him. I have anxiety myself, but diagnoses aside, I find it hard to believe that you would not say yes to a blanket when asked directly. Especially when you consider how disgusting mattresses (and sleeping couches) are without covers, rats or no rats. I'd spent so much time cleaning up my apartment and making everything spotless before the party, so to be told that I basically had to wrap everything in plastic to fit his standards was just insane to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I took a deep breath and tried to explain to him calmly why I thought his words were ridiculous before I went to bed for the night. Truth be told, I didn't want to lose our friendship over this, but I had to log off.

&amp;#x200B;

Next morning, there was a somewhat calm reply. Turned out the whole thing about my animals wasn't his problem. His problem was that he thought one of my other friends had been undermining him, despite this friend being super nice toward him and there were no indications of dislike between either of them during the party. I just gave up at that point. 

&amp;#x200B;

Haven't talked to him since because I blocked him on everything. Despite all of this, I do see some points and it has made me wonder if I overreacted. Again, I get that anxiety can make you nervous and close in on yourself, so the whole blanket and rat situation seems a bit off to me? I guess IвЂ™m mostly confused if IвЂ™m right about calling him out for insulting my animals after being invited into my home?

&amp;#x200B;

Am I the asshole?

AmItheAsshole,"This assessment suggests to me the perspective of someone who understands the physical sensation of sexual pleasure as a novelty accompanying adolescence. This is not how it begins for many people. Perhaps discovering masturbation before puberty is more common in women; I don't know. At any rate, it's not conditioned on awareness of sexuality, maybe not even on the capacity for sexual desire. I knew as a child when I masturbated on purpose that there was an emotional component to the resulting pleasure, but it was many, many years before I could conceive of those feelings as something to be created reciprocally with another person. The only social context I was aware of for that experience was that touching myself there for reasons other than hygienic necessity was dirty and shameful, and no one had even told me anything to that effect. I'm pretty positive the predominant effect of this episode is going to be to teach the daughter that masturbation is bad, with some ramifications probably not revealing themselves for a few years.",0,2

unpopularopinion,"Problem is, we **must** kill to eat.

Whether that's plants or animals, killing is part of the cycle of life. Something eats something else, necessarily killing it.

It's called the food chain, which balance between prey and predator is kept.

It's a system for keeping the population numbers of various living beings in an ecosystem in check.

Humans are at the top of the food chain, with no predators, therefore, we can make or break the food chain, for better or worse.

What you Vegans propose is a chain where carnivores vanish entirely, including carnivorous humans.

Please think: what you do think happens to the herbivores, and the plants they consumes? Both suffer, all because you Vegans blindly, without consideration, put herbivores on a pedestal, without realizing the harm such an imbalance brings to the whole ecosystem.",0,2

That would be a great twist, and it would make the show pretty much amazing again. It would explain BranвЂ™s weirdness, his comments to Sansa, his demand that Sam tell Jon about his parents at the worst possible time, etc. 

Jon having to kill Bran would be pretty cool. Hell, maybe he would have to kill Dany in order to kill Bran, pretty much fulfilling the prophecy completely. 

It would also be a much better explanation for why the NK went directly after Bran. The idea of him being вЂњhumanityвЂ™s memoryвЂќ or whatever was pretty stupid.

some roles and champions you just ""get""

if ADC is a role you understand how to play intuitively, stick with it

stick to 1-2 ADCs only to climb more effectively. learn their build paths and mechanics inside out

Should we just consider it uncouth, and not in some way likely (or should be) illegal? I don't think so. And I think we are severely overlooking the consequences of where our current acceptance of that leads. 

That said, I'm all on board with going after Trump for other transgressions as well. But down playing both Russian influence and Trump's (and co) eagerness and awareness (and the subsequent seeming obstruction), I feel is a giant mistake, even given political risks.

This on the other hand is wildly looked at, circulated, scruntized.

I'm not sure if Barrs involvement in Iran-Contra was really publicized at the time, and certainly while all the actions around it were butt fucking illegal, it didn't have the smell of something illegal to the American public, alot of the details didn't surface to until much later, with many more being quietly shuffled away during HWs presidency.

AskReddit,"I havenвЂ™t seen proof of the world ending in 12 years yet let alone the statement coming from a reliable source, but I do agree that we urgently need to do something about global warming. The three things that cause global warm are Carbon Dioxide, Methane, and water vapor. We canвЂ™t really do much about the water vapor, but we can do things about the other two. The main thing humans are doing to contribute to an increase in Methane right now is agriculture. Cows are the main producers or methane so we should cut down on meat production. IвЂ™m not saying ban cows like the green deal (which IвЂ™m so glad didnвЂ™t pass since it was just a cash grab), but to just cut down on it. Although IвЂ™m not so sure how and were we would make cuts. To address carbon dioxide emissions, I would cut down on air travel. One of the largest contributors to CO2 by human activity is air travel. We could have the super rich cut down on all their flying in private planes and jets. Also once the Tesla electric cars become more affordable it would be ideal if people were to switch to them. Although this is an ideal situation since some people wonвЂ™t be able to switch if they are part of the lower income class. The last thing I would suggest is invest in Green and smart technology and research. The reason developed countries such as the US and Canada donвЂ™t look like modern day Mongolia, the Philippines and the smog cities in China, is because of our green technology.

It was my first reading of The Forsaken though that peaked my interest, the project and video upped it even more for me.

It wouldnвЂ™t have been disappointing for him to fight the NK. ThatвЂ™s what the story was building to. They subverted it to surprise the audience.

Maybe he figured that if he wrote that Trump was guilty, Barr would find a way to censure the report and never make it public. By dancing around the answer, he ensured that the report would get released.

He makes you think Ned is the guy that's gonna solve it all and get to the root of the problem with the corrupt throne. Then it's Robb and Cat, with some aid from Renly. Then it's Stannis. But all of these were masterfully crafted red herrings. None of those characters were ever the ""main characters"" you just *thought* they were. The protagonists have always been Jon, Arya, Sansa, Theon to an extent, Dany, Bran (but I've got theories that he's not just a wholesome greenseer) If you look back at all of she sticky situations the actual main characters were in over the years, you can see that they were *never in real danger*. Why would Arya die a blind panhandler in bravos? Why would Sansa get tortured to death by ramsay Bolton? Ask yourself, ""for what purpose would this character die?"" and in every situation our main heroes were in over the years, them dying at that time made zero fucking sense. *There has always been plot armor*. Fucking Valyrian steel, dragonglass studded plate armor on every God damn one of our protagonists.

Now, I understand the gripes people have with the unrealistic situations Sam was in in ep3, Grey worm to a certain extent, yeah I guess Lyannas death was a bit cheesy on my 3rd re-watch but when it was live, I fucking loved it. I get that having *only* redshirt die in the crypts was a bit unbelievable. I wouldn't of minded maybe 2 more minor characters die who's arcs were complete like Grey worm and missandei.

AskReddit,"Oh my goodness, here we go. So this is going to sound crazy, but I swear it actually happened.

Some years during my childhood, I'd have this recurring dream where a dinosaur would appear out of the television and chase me around. When I was 8 (this was sometime in May), the dream happened again, except it was this shadowy creature with green eyes. This was the night I finally realized I could just unlock my front door and escape the house -- so I did. When I got outside, this white bus parked on the side of the road close to my house. Of course, I didn't want to stay behind with the shadowy thing, so I got on. The bus took me to this academy where we were taught to fight these things called Nightmares. When I arrived, I met this dude who was about 2 years older than me, with dark hair and laurel gray/grayish-green eyes named Marcus. (There's a lot more detail before the next paragraph, but it would take a LONG time to write that, so I'll just explain the important bits there.)

When I was maybe 14, I was asked by a teacher to go take some papers to the office. As I was walking, I noticed this group of shady-looking businessmen. After some investigation, Marcus and I discovered they were part of this evil corporation that wanted to basically overrun the world with Nightmares and awaken this ancient demon.

Thus began the epic quest of Marcus and I, and the companions we met along the way.

(\*Also, a note on how I'm distinguish **N**ightmares and **n**ightmares: Nightmares (with a capital N) are created by the corporation, kind of artificial things; they're inherently evil because that's how the corporation made them. The lowercase nightmares are organic/biological and not necessarily bad.)

I'm not sure how related to this thread all of this technically is, but here's what I'm getting at:

I've woken up about maybe a third into the final battle and have tried to go back to sleep to see how it ends, but it's been a few years and I still haven't dreamt about the rest of it.

AskReddit,"Not a medical, but by parents refused us the chance to visit my uncle after that one last time the whole family met.

Now the man was a warrior, through and through. Given a few months for brain cancer, went on for eleven years. Battle epilepsy, debt, cardiac condition-related problems, and the likes. One night, my aunt calls everybody over at her sister's house; me, being the rebellious teen that I was, didn't really want to go, having the black sheep brand and not being close with a part of the family at the time. After going out and getting my then girlfriend back home, I call him on the payphone all all this idiot is able to tell me is ""If you want to see your uncle, tonight is your last shot, I'm coming to get you"" and hangs up on me.

The tumor had finally won over the Temodal and chemo and had started growing at an out of control rate, out of the blue. My aunt now had to feed him, help him go take a leak, the works. And this lovable idiot, this goofhead, the guy that kept the whole goddamn family tied together for years, is sitting there, looking at the TV but not really comprehending what's going on, and *he's alone.*

Everybody is sitting in the kitchen, conspiring and whispering and trying to plan the next moves, and he looks so scared, and I'm not even sure I can finish this post by now, but he sits there alone, like you'd sit down a kid in front of the TV to hush him, and I refuse for him to be alone, so I went and sit. It just seemed insane that they wouldn't at least try to spend some time with him, y'know?

And we had a talk about the hockey season, and the whatnot, and he was confused, slowed, but *still there.* Out of nowhere he focuses on me, tells me that he wished he could've seen what kind of man I'd grow into, and see me happy with children and wife, and then pointed to the football match that was on and told me they sure had changed the rules for hockey, because he couldn't understand the game anymore. That's the last I heard from him and I'm still not able to deal with it.

I don't and annoyingly I can't find any reconstructions of Proto-Aymara, Proto-Quechua, or Proto-Quechua-II. I asked an acquaintance who speaks Kichwa (a related Quechuan language). If it's close to the Southern Quechua form *kКјumar* it's reasonable to assume the older form was similar also.

The Spanish did record some Quechua words in the 1500s (as it was the language of the Inca Empire). I can't find if they recorded the word for sweet potato.

Also, variants of \*kumala may be limited to Eastern Polynesian languages (the languages of Hawaii, Easter Island, New Zealand, Tahiti, the Cook Islands, etc). The time depth of Eastern Polynesian is not longвЂ”they probably started to split apart around 1000 AD. So there hasn't actually been all that much time for the words to diverge too much.

As our nation grew we implemented laws and educated people to the point that we are able to resolve disputes far more peacefully than we have in the past. 

The problem is that we can only go so far with it before we begin to negatively affect what we hope to positively affect. A government can restrict speech more than our government currently does but there is an invisible line that it could cross which would have negative effects that would far outweigh any of the positives it had before then. This invisible line could be crossed decades before its consequences emerge, that line being something that chews its way through the perceived individualism our nation was built on.

I believe the same holds true for both our first and second amendments. That invisible line has terrifying consequences and I don't even want to come close to crossing it. 

If we agree that trying to be ""perfect"" isn't viable then we have settle for something less. What is that something? Is 0.00045% close enough to zero? It's a serious question.

Did he relocate the team to the AFC because Peyton had a strong preference for the conference so he didnвЂ™t have to compete with Eli?  Peyton was going to get a record setting deal wherever he went regardless. Elway having better people skills than Jed York doesnвЂ™t make him some great QB evaluator.  
  
Elways best asset as a GM by far has been his acquisition of FA talent outside of Peyton, and that itself was helped by PeytonвЂ™s presence as it is.

unpopularopinion,"I've often thought people's attitude after an accident should have a hell of a lot of bearing on their right to drive! I used to ride a motorcycle in Sydney, for over 10 years. I had four or five crashes and my bike was knocked over while parked about the same number of times (no footpath parking so it was really hard to avoid). I reckon in just one case did the driver apologise, and in the majority of cases they expressly denied everything or tried to blame me.
So I think the attitude counts for a lot, including in your example. Maybe the old person re-testing needs to take this into account a lot more. My dad got more cautious- not ridiculously so, but much less agressive than the average- which used to cause people to blow their horns and yell and be turds, which as you can imagine really helped him be a better safer driver.",0,1

It's not a sense of entitlement either, it's just the simple fact of the matter that, after the gameplay has become stale (which it has), why should I continue playing? Some decent content would help. Another map, more weapons, a new legend, MAYBE even some additional lore would provide some value to the game. It's not entitlement to think that the game should provide more than the bare bones experience that it does. If anything, I simply want the game to be better which is not a bad thing.

Was like doing a burnout for a hour and a half, my emotions, my heart rate, all of it was just constant waiting for that something to really hit. And it never does. Although I do enjoy the cinematography of the film it feels like SnyderвЂ™s most spliced up film. Like a comic book IвЂ™m reading but skipping every 3 pages and figuring out the story from that.

&gt;Now, six thousand years later (or eight thousand as True History puts forward), the Wall made to defend the realms of men is still manned by the sworn brothers of the NightвЂ™s Watch, and neither the Others nor the children have been seen in many centuries.

That's putting the Wall being built as early as six thousand years ago.

A quote straight from GRRM:

&gt;This one really puts the PRE in prequel, since it is set not ninety years before GAME OF THRONES (like Dunk &amp; Egg), or a few hundred years, **but rather ten thousand years (well, assuming the oral histories of the First Men are accurate, but there are maesters at the Citadel who insist it has only been half that long).**

No shit comments online don't justify shooting anybody, but that's not what OP said.

And some people think her taking the blood test to prove ancestory was a bad move because being blood related doesnt make you native american.

It is my opinion that you are free to donate to any charity you support, but doing it вЂњin honor ofвЂќ someone who finds the cause to be one they DO NOT support, is in general an Asshole move best reserved for oneвЂ™s mortal enemies and those for whom one has no respect.

gameofthrones,"I wasn't particularly pleased with the execution of that tbh. No idea how she even got so close without somebody noticing.

You can see that the Night King has the whole Godswood surrounded by a horde of the undead in a circle round the side. Then there is a large amount of open ground between the inside of that circle and the Night King in the centre.

In order to stab the Night King she has to get from the keep to the godswood, and then somehow traverse the ranks of wights which are standing at least 4 or 5 deep (if not more) behind the generals, then nip between the generals and cross the huge portion of open ground (as illustrated by Theon's lengthy charge) to the Night King without being noticed at any point. She has to do all of that at speed which would also make her more noticeable. Further, no matter how silent you are that doesn't stop you being seen unless she can turn invisible (which she can't).

Her stealthiness is also undermined by the fact that she couldn't even get out of a room past 4 or 5 of them a few scenes before without being noticed let alone past a whole watching force of them. Yeah, sure, she was noticed because the White Walkers heard her blood falling from her head to the floor but doesn't that just show how good their senses are that they can hear a drop of blood hitting stone from half a room away? How unlikely it is that somebody could just run through them unnoticed?

It just really strained my suspension of disbelief for her to just pop-up in a seemingly impossible place at just the right time. I take it all back if it transpires in a later episode that Bran was warging inside the White Walkers so they didn't see her or something.

Epic store is new and still barebones and doesnt offer as much as steam (for the developers, things like the store page forum, leaderboards, rewards and so on).

My guess is the dog is testing boundaries and misbehaving with you because you're new and taking away your boyfriend's attention and affection that used to be directed solely at the dog. You can try making friends with the dog, by taking it on walks and playing with it, and by giving it boundaries and discipline. Stop it when it destroys your belongings, and make your boyfriend pay for their replacements. If the dog nips at you, or pulls the blankets off you, or takes your food, correct the behavior. If you're not sure of the best way to do this, consider taking an obedience class with the dog. Training sessions can be a good way to bond and also make sure the dog respects you. If your boyfriend is not supportive of your efforts, or consistently undermines them, its a pretty good sign he's valuing a misbehaving dog over your relationship and it is probably time for you to move on.",0,71

I don't have many people to talk to around me (I have a fair amount of family but they wouldn't approve of the break up) so anyone's advice is valued advice!

I do have family within a 30/min radius that I could stay.

But yes, I definitely do feel more entitled to the house because I worked my butt off to close it, then again to furnish it, and spent years longer living in it - I absolutely would not be willing to give it up in the split.
It is as precious to me as my dogs are, it is my home, that I earned and cared for, while as he just moved in to a readymade home and may claim it as just as much his!

Anyway.
D has made it very clear that if we were to split he would want absolutely no contact with me, not even civility, and all child custody/care would have to be arranged without us speaking, and we wouldn't maintain any kind of friendship or civility, even for the sake of our child, which makes the concept of arranging where she would stay on what days of the week very difficult.

What shouldвЂ™ve happened after both sides found out was an open discussion about how to broach this topic with their daughter (not sure if the daughter had already told her mom, but OP shouldвЂ™ve talked to his wife immediately after finding out instead of jumping straight into a punishment). But also, mom did kinda punk out her own husband in front of their child. Although what OP did was wrong, mom shouldвЂ™ve went to dad to explain her side after daughter came to her.

ItвЂ™s all a learning experience. Some of these issues are new realms for parents, so thatвЂ™s why I understand the divisiveness. LetвЂ™s not get stuck on holding only OP to blame here.",0,1

Most of the aerial shots are about Jon and Dany who are perspective characters.

All three countries have 1 trophy and 1 lost final to their name, but France has 6 semi-final appearances, to the Netherland's 2 and Portugal's 1, and 11 QF appearances to Portugal's 9 and Netherland's 2. Add onto that the fact that France has had consistently more success as a footballing country since the 90s (which factors in people's idea of a Big-5) and that their youth system is unrivaled in the world. 

Before you bring up the CL era (since 92-93) argument, the notion of Big-5 is very recent. Despite that, it's obvious that there are more French teams which have had consistent periods of success than Dutch teams.

The worst part is, they don't even read all of those written words together in a sentence. I can't tell you how many gun-nuts are part of a ""well regulated Militia"". Chances are none of them are.

I'm all for the 2nd Amendment. It was a necessary thing to have when you're literally writing a document that is designed to commit treason against a King. There will be war, perhaps wars in the future, and they wanted to have laws in place to allow normal citizens the opportunity to raise arms should England return, or the sitting government evolve into the same tyranny America revolted against in the first place. The 2nd Amendment wasn't written so everyone can have a play-gun in their house and shoot anyone anytime.

If they really believed in the 2nd Amendment, then to own a gun you have to be a member of the National Guard, or maybe each State gets to form a State Civilian Militia, which consists of responsible gun owners who are well regulated.

relationship_advice,"&gt;I feel like this goes against our entire plan and foundation for our current relationship.

Life is what happens when  you're making other plans. 

Things change. You roll with it. 

Maybe he's not fulfilled by the idea of taking care of the house/future kids and not doing something that earns money. 

Also, while being a homemaker is, in and of itself, work, it is not paying work. And if something happens to your relationship, it leaves the homemaker partner in the proverbial dust. 

I did the stay at home wife thing for a little while after the company I was with went under and before I got a part time gig and went to grad school. It was stressful as hell on me because all the time, in the back of my mind, I had ""what ifs"" cropping up. What if my husband got laid off? What if he got sick? What if he got injured? What if he left? No matter how improbable some things might have been, they still popped up in my head. 

It's possible he's coming from a place like that. 

It's also possible he feels he needs more structure (and maybe external structure) than just being a ""homemaker"" can provide. 

Ask him about it. Ask him why he feels he needs to do more. 

&gt;I want him to focus on things he loves without trying to monetize it. I want him to make art for himself, because he loves doing it!

Tell him that. But also tell him you'll support him if he wants to monetize certain things. An Etsy shop only takes as much time as you want to put into it. You're working on no one's schedule but your own if you're not creating custom designs. 

Having a kind of routine that has an external factor (selling to the public) may be good for him. 

&gt; I don't want to lose the idea that i built in my head of what our dynamic will look like.

dumpster at home? not possible. no one will do it. only a large skip (dumpster) and they cost a FORTUNE $450 to drop off then you have limited time to fill it and then you get charged by weight when they pick it up and dump it (about $900 for 30 yards no joke!). !!! on top of that since its basically JUST ME it would take me months to fill it. that price is for 1 week. I would need 4 30yd dumpster. $5400. where the fuck am I supposed to get that? even assuming I could physically manage to fill each one every week while working over 100 hours a week (not joking. 3 full time jobs) thank god that hell is done with.

&amp;#x200B;

my $8300 in property taxes gets me ""ONE SINGLE"" trash can per week. one. just one. no exceptions. owe. I can pay $10 a month for ONE MORE trash car if I want. nope can't by my own cans. only theirs. only one. $8300 a fucking year in property taxes. fuck this place. used to be 11 pieces. twice a week. now its ONE once per week. fuck this place hard core.

Now do guns help that? Yeah for sure. But do guns also stop that? Yes. Look at the shooting in San Diego. Saved tons of lives. 

Its a massive cluster fuck all around and there isn't a solution because neither side cares enough about *the issue* to sit the fuck down and understand what has already been done. Until we fucking *learn* and are ready to listen to what the people on the other side have to say (goes for both conservatives and liberals) we will just sit here on different sides of the aisle slinging mud and talking shit.

&gt;Done.

AskReddit,"Vote for the right people is probably the best advice. A study showed only 100 companies are responsible for over 70% of pollution iirc. Take an active part in your local community so you can contribute to change larger than yourself if only by a neighborhood. For a family effort consider going out to pick trash, get to know how your food is made and switch to better alternatives if available to you (not saying go vegan or whatever, I'm an avid omnivore, just see if the production of your food can be changed for the better), if buying clothes get durable materials. Natural lasts much longer, opt for wool, cotton, industrial hemp etc instead of ones derived from plastic. Don't shun GMOs, often times they're modified for the benefit of us and the planet. If you use a car but can afford not to and your quality of life isn't terribly reduced please opt for public transport or a bike. If it's not detrimental consider even getting rid of the car, they're a pretty bad investment tbh. That's all the advice I have for now. Of course I'm not telling you to follow all of it but remember that, ultimately, it's big companies donating to campaign funds that are the biggest aggressors and the least we can do is vote for the people with our future's best interest.",0,1

I've also seen multiple posts that seem very concerned with men and boys being able to conform to feminine gender norms, with none about men and boys being able to conform to masculine gender norms. Which, as I've said, I consider to be a big problem in education. This is a very feminist viewpoint. It stands up for the feminine perspective while ignoring the masculine perspective.

My room mate is one of my best friends, good dude. But the dude could sleep through the nuclear apocalypse. I am currently working from home and people I am talking to can hear his alarms. This alarms will go off constantly, ones a shrilly beeping that makes me want to slit my wrist. I have told him he needs to find a different way. He told me its the only way to wake him up. These alarms go off for hours and I want to choke him. So I slam his door for him and leave. He comes in pissed off at me because his cat shit on floor. I did not realize his cat was shut up in there but I didn't care because I am sick of listening to alarms for hours. Hell closing the door didn't help much.

Am I an asshole here?

And I am in no way justifying some of the horrible writing decisions that theyвЂ™ve made in the past few seasons What a lot of people do seem to think itвЂ™s just that theyвЂ™ve always been bad riders but they had some scenes in the early seasons that weвЂ™re not in the books and they actually wrote them phenomenally.

AmItheAsshole,"I'd like to add here that I am the girl who was shamed and repressed for my sexual desires starting when I was about 10. I had started puberty when I was 9 so by 10/11 I had sexual desires. Instead of being told that it was okay and educating me, my mother took away my notebooks that detailed out my curiosities and my door was removed from my room for a while.   
By age 18 I had racked up a sexual body count in the double digits, been preyed on by many an older man online into masturbating, showing off, and talking dirty with them over texts and on camera. I'm now 24 and have finally started to slow down thanks to my girlfriend who has helped me see that my sexuality is actually okay (I always would say that it was okay to be a slut, okay to be gay, etc., but I never really believed it for myself). By now I've gotten up into the hundreds on the people I've been with, and it's a damned miracle I haven't ended up pregnant, riddled with diseases, or murdered.  
If my parents had nurtured that, or even at least ""allowed"" it instead of forcing me to hide it, I would have made much smarter decisions in my life and I probably wouldn't have spent away so much money (mostly on drinking) and time getting laid by one night stand after one night stand. For a while I was that person who was constantly bragging about my sex life to anyone who would listen, because I never got the chance to talk about it *at all* growing up, and so I just *needed* to be heard.  
It's important to at least be accepting, rather than condemning, especially at that age. It took me 14 years to talk about sex with my mom, and I was married for a while, wouldn't even talk about it then.   
Long story short, just accept it. She's going to have desires, and it's better to act on those within your house, in the safety of her bedroom, with plastic and silicone, and the support of her parents. Instead of in public, in the back of some dude's car, or in the grass outside of the church you and your family went to for years.",0,9

freefolk,"&gt; And every single motivation would be lame and ppl would be angry.

Really? You really think that given eight years of show and *twenty-two* years of novels, they couldn't come up with a more compelling motive for the Others/White Walkers than ""look they just want to kill everyone because why not oooooh scary!""?

&gt; Look, I wanted more too, but after ep 2 was pretty clear they just want to bring the endless night, and that was pretty much foreshadow since ever.

Just because they were established to have a lame motivation one episode prior doesn't make it *not* a lame motivation.

&gt; They are these horror stories from old tales that want nothing more than death, thats it.

Which is incredibly lame, if that's *all* they are.

&gt; Even in the books the WW are nothing more the silent killing machines.

The Others have appeared ""on screen"" in the books a grand total of three times so far (two of them in direct sequence), and we've gotten literally not one whisper of their motivations. They're also described as being very, very different and far creepier in my opinion. If the only motivation they get in the *books* ends up being ""because they want to kill stuff"", then I'll honestly be pissed.

&gt; Maybe in the next 2 books GRRM will give it more lore about the first man and the ritual that make them and the magic involved, and maybe they just want to cool down the planet a little bit who knows, and if he ever write the damn battle, Im pretty sure it will take months, a lot of people will heroically die (there is a lot more chars alive in the books anyway) but Im pretty sure that the end will partially be the same.

Literally nothing about the creation of the White Walkers as it is in the show is in the books. It's possible that it'll end up being the same or similar, but I doubt it. Like I said, the book treatment of the Others is far different from how it is in the show.

&gt; And we have some eps left so maybe bran will do some timey whiney stuff and we may undertand more about what was all that.

Yeah, I dunno' about you, but finding out the motivation behind the giant nebulous villain after *they've already been easily defeated* doesn't sound like it will work very well story-wise. It kind of loses its impact at that point.

&gt; Bran still have a plan or he would never be so resolute into tell Jon who he really is. 

You have far more faith in the writers of this show than I do.

&gt; What I dont understand is why a villain like Cersei, a great character with 8 seasons of backstory and way more evil things in her back since freaking ep 1, is dismissed because ""she is not a zombie"" while all people wanted was a freaking blue darth maul that never opened his mouth to be ""THE villain"". I just dont get it.

A whole *hell* of a lot reasons, actually. For one, Cersei is an idiot. She's a good villain, but she's in way over her head, and has been since season 1...until the writers of the show suddenly decided that she was a conniving super genius, right around the time where they started making *actually* intelligent characters like Tyrion and Varys into idiots. And, to be clear, I don't actually mind her getting in some good plots, like with the bombing of the Sept. But being  Super Genius End Boss material is A) not who she is in the books, and B) not even who she is in the earliest seasons of the *show*. She should have been the appetizer conflict in the first half of the season, before the *real* threat of the Walkers was faced.

Second:

&gt; freaking blue darth maul that never opened his mouth to be ""THE villain""

Yeah, because the Night King (who doesn't exist in the books) is a *poorly written villain with no motive*. That doesn't mean he *should* be, because the Others themselves *are* interesting as they're presented to us in the books and in the early seasons of the show. And both the books and the early seasons of the show *clearly* set up the White Walkers as *the* threat. There are multiple prophecies that either do or probably do relate to their defeat, they're set up as an unknown, enormous, existential threat slowly building throughout the series, and they're the focus of *literally the first scene of both the show and the books*. They are *the* villains. The entire point of the Night's Watch plot-line is that while the realms down south are all falling into petty bullshit and power grabs, they're ignoring the *real* enemy that threatens to wipe out all of humanity. That's the entire point, that's why so much time and focus is devoted to them. And then in the show they're fought in *one* major battle and they lose it because a teenager managers to OHKO their leader out of nowhere? And she's not even one of the *many* potential candidates of the *multiple* prophecies? That's a *ludicrous* waste of the literally years of set-up for the threat they posed.

Cersei is an interesting villain, but she is not *the* villain of the series, the Others are. And they got taken out in one episode.",0,1

This has been happening for a while and SundayвЂ™s episode just hammered it home that theyвЂ™ve gone beyond streamlining and straight into not giving a damn about satisfying plot points that have been built up for years.

I worked at a location in California that was the recipient of ARRA funding.  It was a shitshow from the get-go.  There was no oversight, the work was pure shit, and in some cases, the infrastructure was in worse shape after the work was done.  This included roads (gravel and slurry sealing, done as badly as you can imagine), electrical (terrible), solar (also terrible), and so forth.  It was outrageously expensive, and at the end of the contract, the company dissolved so there could be no accountability for the garbage-tier work that they had done.  Billions and billions of taxpayer dollars disappeared with nothing to show for it.

Moral of the story: beware any infrastructure project the Democrats agree with.  It means they've found a way to siphon away the money into a donor or shell company.",0,2

The_Donald,"I previously posted a comment on this subject that was taken down for some reason that I do not know.  But my point is that Trump is pushing for this type of move.  He wants to demonstrate who has the power in our government.  It is not the Congress or the Courts.  It is the President.  If Nadler or Congress try to arrest any Trump people, all Trump has to do is put them in an executive branch office or have a FBI security detail protect the person and that will be the end of any attempt to arrest by the Congress.  Even if the Court system tried to enforce, Trump could simply say no way.  Court has no power without the executive branch enforcing its orders.  The reason this has never happened is because everyone that actually knows what is going on realizes that ultimate power of arrest (Executive function) lays with the President.  Congress and Courts do not have this power and never were supposed to have this power.  This power has been taken by Congress and Courts to help create a deep state.  The only group that benefits from power being taken away from the President is the deep state.  Trump is basically declaring war on the deep state and the way they control this country.  Media will never tell you this but this is what is going on right now.   Trump is pushing them to have this fight.",0,4

2) George can take as long as he wants to let his figurative garden grow, allowing his story to be rich and smart and having everything make a ton of sense, but these guys have a few weeks or a couple of months because they have to be ready for the production to start up each year.

3) TheyвЂ™re talented writers, but they ainвЂ™t G.R.R.M., even if they both had equal time to write the story (which, they donвЂ™t) so given the circumstances theyвЂ™ve unexpectedly found themselves thrown into, I have a soft spot for them, even when they frustrate me at times.

The United States has separation of powers, a military controlled by a civilian government, a Supreme Court, and direct elections. All things the romans didnвЂ™t have. Is today a dangerous time, yes. The Republican Party, despite what you may or may not believe, operates on a wholly different level than the Democratic Party. There is a level of corruption and willingness to cheat because of their dwindling base. I can see republicans dragging their feet on legislation to prevent climate change, raising the taxes on the poor, and raising the national debt but IвЂ™m not afraid of them killing the republic or starting a civil war. IвЂ™m afraid of the people that fervently support the Republican Party from a bad place. Barry goldwater set the poison deep and itвЂ™s been festering since 64 and no Republican President has been willing to do anything to get rid of it. If you go down to the local gun shop and hear the conversations and what they say about the government itвЂ™s nonsensical. Trump and his ilk are a symptom of unchecked nationalism and ignorance thatвЂ™s been allowed to grow unfettered since 64 and is now creeping its way into mainstream politics. That gun shop talk is now political talk. IвЂ™m afraid that when republicans in Congress donвЂ™t go far enough that it will cause a split like it did in 2009. And that will lead to violence. Do I believe weвЂ™re heading for a Roman Empire style coup, no. But I do believe there is the potential for violence, death, and continuous obstruction that will delay the necessary reforms to save us from climate change.",0,2

For shipping and logistics, the cost of air freight is outrageous. I can say from experience, it cost my former employer about 50,000 a week in air shipping costs to move pallets of perishable foods from one coast to another, the per pound cost to fly goods is extreme.

The use of a high speed rail system or systems in the US would make air travel faster, less people to spend an hour in line behind at security,

It would lessen the amount of semi trucks used, saving fuel and wear on our infrastructure 

It would drop costs on products that were otherwise flown 

And it would create more jobs than lost in other industries. Airlines and trucking companies will still exist and do good business, but now an entirely new field of in demand transport has popped up.

nba,"&gt; . The fact that those people are losers is the whole reason why the incel label is powerful, it is used to ridicule and shut down discussion. Not much different than calling someone a SJW, communist/socialist, Nazi, etc.

Labels have meaning. When I call someone a Nazi, it's usually because they're advocating for a white ethnostate, not because I think they're being big meanies. When I call someone an incel, it's because they either a) self-identify as such or b) believe men are owed sex by women and that women are evil.

Also, being identified as a ""social justice warrior"", a communist, or a socialist is not an insult. Calling someone a Nazi or an incel is. If you called me a socialist, I would agree with you, because I believe in the equitable redistribution of wealth to solve social injustices. If you were to call me a social justice warrior, I'd roll my eyes but since I'm passionate about social justice, I wouldn't object.

AmItheAsshole,"^^^^AUTOMOD  ***The following is a copy of the above post. This comment is a record of the above post as it was originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***

To be clear, I love him dearly and we get along really well except for this one little area. 

So my spouse has been making jokes about my body ever since we got married 3 years ago. For some context, he's pretty athletic and disciplined in terms of his diet and training. He trains for Ironman triathlons at least once a year and he does half IMs, marathons, and distance cycling events as ""training"" in addition to his coached sessions. I have never been that athletic nor do I plan to be, ever. At the same time, I have never thought I was fat or have an unflattering figure. I'm 5ft6 and fluctuate between 125-130 lbs. Granted, I don't have the same muscle tone or the athletic build as my spouse, but I consider myself somewhat active. I bike to work everyday which is a good 30 min. But I also eat real food, not Goo or protein bars like my spouse. 

Anyway, my spouse got into triathlons around the time we were married. Since then, he has been making little suggestions about my body and doing things to suggest I diet. Some examples:
- you'll look so much better with some definition in your abs
- aren't you worried about love handles?
- wearing a ""I'm with fatty ----&gt;"" tshirt when we're on vacation
- jesus you have no triceps! you should volunteer to be a research subject at the medical school!
- make me try a vegan diet for a month
- one weekend when I was away on a work trip he cleaned out all the snacks in the pantry so we can try to live ""snack-free"" for a month

I don't really need to keep going but you get the point. I feel like these comments have been coming at me more frequently. At first it was just like one off-handed comment like once a month. And it just kept getting more frequent and now he's making a fat joke like once or twice a week. We celebrated my belated birthday this past weekend. His gift to me was a couple's membership to Orange Theory (a type of exercise class...our neighborhood just got a new studio). When I saw the gift I teared up a little but not because I was happy. I told him I just felt like he doesn't think my body is attractive enough for him. He got offended that I would take his well-meaning gift as a criticism and is still mad at me. Now I feel really terrible and want to find a way to make it up to him. Did I really act assholish by crying and saying those things?

pics,"Vehicles are [extremely risky](https://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/tor_faq/car.jpg) in a tornado. There is no safe option when caught in a tornado in a car, just slightly less-dangerous ones. If the tornado is visible, far away, and the traffic is light, you may be able to drive out of its path by moving at right angles to the tornado. Seek shelter in a sturdy building, or underground if possible. If you are caught by extreme winds or flying debris, park the car as quickly and safely as possible -- out of the traffic lanes. Stay in the car with the seat belt on. Put your head down below the windows; cover your head with your hands and a blanket, coat, or other cushion if possible. If you can safely get noticeably lower than the level of the roadway,leave your car and lie in that area, covering your head with your hands. Avoid seeking shelter under bridges, which can create deadly traffic hazards while offering little protection against flying debris.
https://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/safety.html



As a last resort, lie flat in a ditch, ravine or below grade culvert to protect yourself from flying debris. If no ditch is available, you may remain in your vehicle, put on
your seatbelt, lower yourself below window level, and cover your head with your hands
or a blanket.

My mom/grandma/both would go in and talk to them:

I also used to ""dance for them (read jump around in circles like a 9-year-old on a sugar rush) and it made them smile to no end.

If you look at the team's marketing efforts in recent years you can see a pivot away from being an inoffensive team that appealed to nobody by trying to appeal to everyone.

Now the messaging is ""LA our way"", ""blue collar"", etc.  Some of that is tied to the current group of players and some of it is a bit silly (it's a billion dollar organization employing millionaires).  However, what it is an attempt to create an identity that is attractive to LA residents that aren't pulled in by the Hollywood glitz and glamor of the Lakers.

If you spend enough time living in LA, you will find lots of people that HATE the Lakers, but also have no love for any other team.  That is the group that the Clippers need to target, not current Lakers fans.

TL;DR: it will always be a Lakers-first city, but the Clippers can find their own success by establishing an identity and culture that appeals to selected groups of LA residents.",0,1

-- A universe in which Capt America was alive and well during the entire 20th century and lived to a ripe old age before disappearing (going back to the current timeline). 

-- The 4th universe is our own in which every event covered in the movies happened, but the 50% that were snapped out of existence were brought back 5 years later.

There are at least those, but potentially many more. Especially since we don't know how Capt America replaced the stones exactly. Could be several just from his little escapade.

Of the 4 universes, I would say the 3rd one might be the most fucked up because no Capt America for any of the ""22 movies"" can't be good. Thanos might win that timeline.

movies,"You should really watch it again.  

She initiates the divorce after he quit his job (without talking to her), threw an expensive birthday party for their son (after they had agreed to only have a small party because his grades were bad), and brought livestock into their house. This was the final straw in a marriage that he clearly has no respect for.

Because she has a stable, well paying job, and can afford to pay for the house they live in, she stays in their house with the kids while he moves out. The court decides that shared custody will be based on his ability to get a steady job and a place to live. That's completely reasonable. In those three months, he has unsupervised visitation.  

He gets a job as a janitor and an apartment. But rather than focus on building a life for his kids and himself, he sabotages his wife's attempt to find someone to help around the house, and then deceives his wife and children in order to exert control over their lives. Including, but not limited to, vandalizing the car of a man that wants to date her, assaulting him, and putting cayenne pepper in his food (knowing he's allergic to it.)  

When everything finally comes out, why wouldn't she be freaked out? Living a double life, lying to his family and the court? You say there's no sign of mental issues, but the whole thing could be construed as mental illness.  

And in the end, after the judge sets supervised visitation, she goes to the court to request his visitation be unsupervised, and that he takes care of the kids after school.

I mean, Daenerys blatantly saved Jon's life in the last episode by torching the wights, twice if you count Drogon swooping down and knocking The NK off of Viserion as he was aiming to spear down Jon+Rhaegal.

The age gap exists, but it's never been a problem. We often don't even really notice. He acts wiser and more mature than me sometimes, but other times it's vice-versa.

A bank deciding to disclose financial records just because some number of high ranking decision makers want to is illegal, and should not be allowed.

It was a huge a giveaway to (surprise, surprise) rich real estate investors to build and operate toll roads that are about 80% funded by the taxpayer. Basically the way it works is that private investors can buy into one-sixth of the project. Then they get a huge (82%) tax break on the revenue that the project generates ... but only if the project generates revenue. It's just a tax cut with voodoo economics projecting magical infrastructure gains. It ends with grossly overbuilt infrastructure that is crumbling because we never maintain it. It's a plan to build new, not fix anything. We already have this problem and this would be even worse. We already have vastly more miles of lanes and pipes and bridges per ca-pita than any other country, and it'll bite us in the ass eventually.

Oh, wanna guess how this ends? Nancy and tardboy Schumer come back to the table to hear Trumps infrastructure plan. See its a scam and say no and then Donny blames the dems for not making a deal.

Essentially makes the Night King out to be kind of a good guy in that he wanted to destroy the Three Eyed Raven to prevent the White Walkers from ever being created again when humanity inevitably begins to grow out of control. 

Evidence being the mysterious origins of the dagger used to kill NK and it's appearance in old history books, as well as the mannerisms Bran (or what was left of him) displays when he hands the dagger to Arya; including the rather cloudy circumstances around the NKs creation and the continuing mystery of the recurring White Walker symbols and their appearance during his creation.

freefolk,"Well to be somewhat fair, when youвЂ™re outnumbered 1 million to 100k youвЂ™re probably going to fall back to вЂњaite, letвЂ™s hold the castleвЂќ.

Also, in the after credits exposition DD reveal that Dany leaving to go fight with the extinguishing Dothraki isnвЂ™t part of the plan. 

After that plan is broken a lot of what goes on is improv.

I also think people trying to be military strategists is dumb when 

1) youвЂ™re fighting magic creatures that break convential war methods...

2) they didnвЂ™t have infinite prep time between arriving in Winterfell and the dead coming

Maybe two weeks total, 10 days or less is probably more realistic.

Theon says bye to Yara in Kings Landing and thatвЂ™s about a 10-day boat journey to Winterfell with good winds and a small crew. 


But anyways, I mean if you loaded up the castle with a trap, maybe the NK starts in the Crypt and works his way up raising the dead soldiers over and over again.

Plus... they also had a dragon.

All these people being like... yah why didnвЂ™t the riders flank. 

You canвЂ™t really have non-plot-armored Dothraki flank an undead army and beat a zombie dragon.

The scenes may have not told a compelling military story the way the battle of the bastards did. But it told an emotional one and showcased the chaos of fighting the dead.

ThatвЂ™s good enough IMO.",0,1

videos,"First one I couldn't quite make out. Sounds like the pilot was coming through some cloud cover and wanted someone to double-check his approach or something. Tower was probably right in that they can't always do all of that, but was an asshole about it.

Second one: plane was being asked to taxi to a certain runway, but went the wrong way to get there. ATC saw it and thought he was going to the wrong runway, tried to correct him. Pilot was an ass about it. 

Third: ATC was giving a pilot approach directions to land (from what angle, heading, and runway). Pilot was not responding back to acknowledge, which they are expected to. ATC was cursing him out but didn't realize his mic was hot. Rest of the pilots and tower controllers in the area were commenting on that. 

4th: someone was giving someone else a radio frequency 27.87 but whoever they were telling it to kept hearing the wrong number.

5th: JFK tower confirming where a plane is so he can give them correct taxi instructions to take off. They keep answering the wrong question. 

6th: Not entirely sure why, but the plane was coming in for a landing and could not make the requested runway for some reason. They stated they could not and could only make a closer/easier one. they declared an emergency and told the tower to clear the runway because they couldn't land anywhere else. He kept ignoring them and telling them to follow to the runway he gave them instead.",0,18

AmItheAsshole,"NTA. IвЂ™m a female in my mid-20s, and from my perspective I think that itвЂ™s inappropriate for a 12 year old to have sex toys вЂ” regardless of gender. Where I live, sex shops and websites require a person to be 18+ to purchase, which I think is fair. Most of these comments mention the idea that вЂњall kids masturbate, who cares, stop being a dickвЂќ and I can understand where theyвЂ™re coming from in some ways but I can also understand the viewpoint of this father and if it were my daughter or younger sister/younger self, I would just encourage them to live their childhood and not push them into a sexual lifestyle at such a young age. I think that your wife has good intentions in trying to defend your daughter, but disrespecting you in front of your kid and arguing about it is not the way to go about it. You shouldвЂ™ve insisted on talking to her in private about the situation and being a little more open-minded about her opinion so that she doesnвЂ™t feel gaslighted. 
As a final note вЂ” each 12 year old kid matures at their own pace; some being overly childlike and prepubescent while others look/act/feel like a teenager.

asoiaf,"&gt; What was the point of bringing Jon back, or having Daenerys bring her dragons to Winterfell if they were't going to be used to fight the Night King, especially if fire doesn't harm him?

I understand a lot of the complaints, but I really don't understand this one, and it seems to be incredibly common.

Do you seriously think if Dany wasn't present and Jon never came back things would have been the same? No dragons, dothraki, or unsullied are present. No northern lords rallying around Jon Snow. The Boltons hold Winterfell and they have a very tenuously loyal houses with them. 

And for some reason you think that the circumstances would have still be the same and that Arya would have gotten a chance to kill him somehow? This just makes zero sense.

Part of the point of the show is that prophecy can't always be trusted. But even if we set that aside, it isn't at all to argue about how that battle would not at all have happened that way without Jon and Dany doing what they had done up to this point. They could still be fulfilling prophecy just by doing what they have done to mount this defense and make it possible that a third party like Arya could get the killing blow.

People acting like all that build up with Jon and Dany for no payoff are entirely missing the point. Their victory was the payoff regardless of who made the final blow.",0,3

AmItheAsshole,"I'm going out on a limb that ESH because I have a story to tell.  Actually, two stories.  My daughter had known it was expected that at 12-ish, I have access to that information should I choose to take a look.  Funny thing is, I never used it but came across some issues completely by surprise.

&amp;#x200B;

She was waking up in the morning EXTREMELY tired having gone to bed when she would have gotten 9+ hours of sleep.  I was still getting Verizon paper bills then and saw that she had sent a HUGE number of texts, to the tune of 8700 in the previous month...on a dumb phone with a slider keyboard.  At that point, she was working on the trust of having more freedom and doing well, until I found the obnoxious number of texts going until 3 am.  Her phone was limited to contacts in her phone for texting.  What she had learned, was that if she couldn't text someone, they could text her and she could reply.  I wasn't paying for service that would restrict it that much because..well, she needs to be trusted.

&amp;#x200B;

That number of texts and her tiredness in the mornings got me looking at that month's texts, which led to finding at least 3 males requesting nudes, which she didn't send (awesome!).  That led to authorities in three states becoming involved and the issue eventually went away.  More of a scare the hell out them likely happened as to my knowledge no charges were filed because she hadn't actually sent any.

&amp;#x200B;

The other story was her Google+ account.  I used G+ at one point to communicate with a software beta group and one of her posts came up in my feed.  I looked at comments on one picture and found that a guy in town told her she was cute and said they should meet.  It turns out that he was a registered sex offender and worked just a few miles away.  He and I had a discussion and he disappeared from the internet.

&amp;#x200B;

Both were used as teachable moments because to learn safe behavior and when to spot trouble, but she did have her privileges and access scaled back for a while.  The hammer came down, but not so much on her, as the walking hormones that tried to exploit her.

&amp;#x200B;

Pod spent years being trained by Brienne(who beat the hound who supposedly trained Arya) and to a lesser extent by Bronn. Because of that he is seen is a competent fighter. Not the greatest but respectable. 

That is what makes her a mary sue. Every other character is grounded in reality except her. Oh she spent a few weeks talking to Tywin? Guess that makes her the greatest tactician of all time. Tyrion who spent his entire life around Tywin and still makes mistakes? Heh he can't win all the time. Theon, also a competent fighter, gets stabbed in the gut and almost immediatly dies?

AmItheAsshole,"You *can,* but that isn't what is happening here. It doesn't matter what often happens, what matters is what happened here, and it's simply based out of ignorance. There is no attempt to treat her as lesser, nor any intention of treating her differently from how he himself likely grew up.

In no way is this prejudice, discrimination, or stereotyping. If you think it is, you badly need to look up the definitions of each, and then justify how his actions could remotely qualify as any of the three. Discrimination by definition requires there to be a class that is treated differently/better than her. He's ageist at absolute worst, because that is his **actual** issue. He doesn't think a **12-year-old should be owning a sex toy.** he rules nothing out for the future.

And the reason why the semantics matters here is an ignorant asshole is much less of an asshole than a sexist asshole. An ignorant asshole simply needs education or discussion. A sexist asshole is like that at the root of their person and carries negative beliefs about an entire sex.

You're more than welcome to prove where he holds any perceivable negative view of women or his daughter. Otherwise your argument carries zero validity. 

And you're also holding him to a standard you won't hold his wife to. His wife completely undermined his authority in front of their daughter and basically taught her to pout (both had their arms crossed) in response to things they don't like. She showed a complete and total lack of respect for her partner and they could likely have come to a reasonable solution if she had done what you're suggesting instead of immediately going on the offensive.",0,-1

AskReddit,"You know, this thread is just making me anxious and sad. I'm not a medical worker or any worker at all really. Just some kid who needs to get something off his chest in a thread where the mood and topic fit motor less enough. One of my best friends, we've known each other for almost 12 years now, almost our entire lives has had cancer since he was little. I'm not sure when exactly it started but I feel like it was pretty much at birth. When I met him he'd already fought cancer once, if not more. It's been to long to remember clearly. I've gone through a lot of cancers with him, I think it's been 7 by now (including the ones I didn't witness). As much as I hate to say it, nature pretty much fucked him up bad. I wish I could at least say I was there for him all the time but honestly... I'm not so sure about that. We went to different ""grade schools"", were in different classes for most of our continuing education and just got back together around 2 years ago, almost 3. We never really separated, we just drifted apart a little. Or a lot. Who am I to judge. We didn't do a lot together, didn't know each other anymore etc. He missed school a lot anyway, surgery and illness kept him at home where he was forced to be alone all day, maybe accompanied by his family and some friends if his health allowed. His cancer came back (again) some time between 2017 and 2018 I think. I'm not sure anymore which year it was, I've been adrift in my own darkness for a while. Which ever one it was, 17 seems more likely, was our year. We did so much together over the summer, going to lakes and beaches around the area. Having parties and barbecues. You know the deal. Then it got worse, and by worse I mean a lot worse. He had surgery last year. He was bad before, then he had a little high and plummeted right back down there into an even deeper hole he couldn't control or escape, yet anyway. He's been stuck at home since summer last year slowly getting worse. There's not really anything that anyone can do as it seems. He's getting more and more paralysed. Less and less motivated. And the only thing that could make him a little better is slowly drifting away. His friends. It's so hard to stay close when you're unable to see each other because he can't come to school. Additionally it's hard to visit him because it's pretty much a gamble if he's in a position where that's possible. And it makes me feel horrible. I feel like I abandoned him. Sadly I've got some shit of my own so it's not like I can just flip that coin every day, hoping he's able to do something. I hate how harsh that sounds, I'm just bad at words. My biggest fear is that I might not be there for him in the moment he needs me the most. And even worse, I'm not sure how I would react to his possible death of that is what it's going to end up being. Will I be sad? Will I be able to be sad? I don't want to lose him. But maybe I already did.",0,6

I would try to explain concerns about the message this sends your daughter to your spouse, in a non-confrontational way.

In all of the encounters the various characters had they never saw the undead foot soldiers use ranged weapons.  With that in mind you can assume only the generals will have ranged weapons and those are ice spears (that do fly far).  Not enough to be concerned about in an attrition war, just keep your two dragons safe.  

The undead army has a dragon and maybe some giants, that is it for seige weapons.  Considering this is a siege situation and the defenders have two dragons this makes for a huge advantage.  Against a human army of this composition, Winterfell could not fall.  They could starve to death, though, so you would need to attack.

A Unique problem about fighting the white walkers is your own dead troops can be used against you.  Everyone knows this and everyone knows they are already outnumbered.  Normally I'd try and bottleneck an enemy like that but the numbers of undead they were expecting means you would run out of arrows.  Plus the defenders had a very powerful calvary advantage.

Massed infantry is a terrible target for calvary, calvary wants thin lines they can just plow through.  (Normally they would also harrass archers or support and run down fleeing enemies but the undead don't have any of that).  So you want to the enemy to stretch out to allow calvary to plow through.  Worse case scenario the lines are still too thick, in that case the calvary can just roam the backlines doing hit and runs.  Either way you don't send such a powerful unit in to die in the opening charge.  You especially don't do it when you can't even see the enemy line.

There was no good reason for the living to instigate the fight in the dark.  When they charged they clearly didn't know what the enemy line even looked like.  If they had to fight at night the trebuchets should have been used to light the forest on fire, that way at least the silhouette would be visible.  They shouldnhave also fired those things until the undead overran them.  Could even use them to draw out the initial undead charge.

The trench was a good idea.  We will assume they didn't have time to dig multiple and that is why they only had one ring worth.  We will also assume they didn't have enough time to make a wider or deeper trench.

They should of had tar/oil to dump over the walls.  We will just assume they couldn't get any for some reason.

Dragonglass shrapnel bombs would have been smart but again we can just assume they didn't have the time to do that.

Unsullied on the walls with dragonglass tipped spears would have been great.  First row thrusts downward, that is a lot of reach to help stop climbers.  Second tow is there to stab any climbers that make it past the others.  Northern fighters with swords on the stairs or court to stop anything that gets past the Unsullied.

It looked like they did a good job with inner defensive barricades in the court.  It was just everything outside of the castle that they fucked away.

I'm not even factoring in the two dragons considering the plan was to hold them back until the NK showed up.  Those two could have absolutely wrecked the undead when they got tied up at the trench.",0,1

funny,"Please refer to my earlier comment discussing the distinction between feelings and reality.

Let me see if I can add context here... let's say you were a real scientist and you were running an experiment about the effectiveness of vaccines.  In a controlled environment you would test the impact of the administration of vaccines on one group of people and maintain another bunch as a control group.  The participants would have no awareness of which group they were in.  After collecting data you would analyze it and look for the impact of the administration of vaccines, and learn that they represent a statistically significant improvement in human health.  And then some fucktard who slept through the lecture about the difference between 0 and 90 would stand up and say, ""I kinda feel like vaccines cause autism.""  Which one do you think is actually accurate, the one dealing with reality, or the one who considers feelings to be scientifically valid?",0,-4

AskReddit,"The amount of meta posts and subs that are all meta posts sort of showed up in the past 2 or 3 years and have gotten pretty bad in the past year.  It's just the worst most low effort content that feels like a nightmare out of the old circlejerk sub.  Those posts literally only exist to gain karma and they are super blatant about it.  When people say ""this place us more like facebook"" they're referring to this begging for likes shit.

It's getting harder to spend as much time here as before because these kind of posts end up on every sub, and they've pretty much ruined me_irl despite the rule against them that isn't enforced.  Subs like highqualitygifs I cant even understand from either a viewer or creator perspective since it's just really bad content that can only be shared here where like a good YouTube video or Twitter post you can show anybody.  Like if you showed people on any circlejerk sub 5 years ago what that place has looked like for the past 2 years I've been aware of it, they would have deleted their own subs because they're forever out jerked.  

These posters just come off as pathetic, being reddit famous just seems pathetic to me, yet so many posts feel like people are going for that and it's bonkers because it's the most who cares shit.  There's always been karma whoring, but it's never been this blatant, it's like there's no shame anymore.

It's still a decent place to find content, but I feel like I have to look harder for it or scroll past way more than I used to.  This past year for the 1st time in like 5+ years I subscribed to more subreddits because this place went from being a good way to kill 1-2 hours to just like 30 minutes, still didnt make too much difference tbh.  The best places are the ones that are only occasionally on all or make it like 5+ pages deep on all semi regularly, although the more popular a place gets, the shittier it becomes where the opposite used to be more true.  

Ask reddit is still the best time killer though, like it's the least shitty text posts on the whole site and they're are average medium to long.",0,1

My friends were going on a short weekend trip and my mom told me to go with them and get out of the house for a bit. She was really adamant about me going. Said вЂњIвЂ™ll be here when you get back.вЂќ She passed away the day before I got back. My dad told me later that she didnвЂ™t think that mentally IвЂ™d be able to handle watching her die.

soccer,"These fans are pathetic and disgraceful and it's right they should be exposed, banned for life from attending football matches and tried for their crimes. I'm sure they will be found and made accountable.

Liverpool FC has a very low tolerance for this type of behaviour from their fans, is one of the safest most inclusive places anywhere to watch a football match and will certainly act in suitable manner on this issue. 

Liverpool fans have a good travelling reputation but just like every club, there will always be some bad element. 

Last year, Liverpool ranked 11th in of all Premier league clubs in arrest numbers (18) with West Ham, Man Utd and Arsenal (46, 40, 30 respectively) having the most and Bournemouth, Watford and Swansea (3,4,6 respectively) having the least. 

As any sane person will know, there is not a big club in Europe that doesn't have it's own number of criminal supporters but Liverpool is in no objective way anywhere near the worst. 

There is obviously no justification for the actions of these fools today at all and likewise, there is also no justification for the rampant anti-English and anti-Liverpool sentiments in this thread and on twitter either. 

Just more fools using this incident to try and justify their own disgusting prejudices, feigning outrage at this bullying and racism and in the same breath brandishing their hate for all Liverpool fans and/or all English fans with sweeping pejoratives and prejudice.",0,6

The situation is still solvable regardless of the odds. In regards to a deus ex machina, the situation is supposed to not have any foreseeable solutions to the problem.

Very confused by your second point. They knew Arya was killing the Night King in season 7, Bran giving her the dagger was absolutely foreshadowing.

&gt;At that precise moment, for the viewers knew, Arya was the only person whose fighting style could make use of it. Bran had not even voiced his plan of baiting the Night King into facing him yet

That doesn't make it not foreshadowing? This doesn't disprove anything.

&gt;The White Walker that dueled Jon was surprised because it did not expect Jon to have a weapon immune to destruction

I know that's like exactly what I said haha.

&gt;Jon would have been dead if not for plot armor, given how the White Walker spends a great deal of time throwing him around instead of impaling him as it did with the Thenn.

Or you know how I just explained in my post, White Walkers have always been cocky and their hubris was their biggest weakness. They intentionally take their time and don't try very hard because they usually don't have to.

&gt;None of this indicate that humans can physically compete with White Walkers, only that Valyrian Steel won the day.

Except for the fact that they still had a sword fight and Jon kicked their ass (as I mentioned in the post). 

&gt;If White Walkers could actually feel hubris, then the Night King would have tried to kill Jon in single combat.

Hubris doesn't equal stupid necessarily. The Night King is cocky but he isn't just going to stupidly risk his life with a guy who he knows has taken down a White Walker.",0,8

&amp;#x200B;

After taking care of my neighbors dog for around 4 years, I've started learning her habits and other things. She is a lot like most dogs, but recently I noticed several things. I have a routine I do to let her know I'm about to leave, since she seemingly loves out time together. I pat her head three times, and wave goodbye three times (A little OCD I know, but it works). Recently she started putting the top of her head against a wall or chair or couch when I'm near her. It took me awhile to figure it out, but I realized the reason she does this is because she knows that I can't leave until I pat her head, so she sees this as a way of keeping me by her. 12/10, love her to bits.",0,3

And by your definition they all own guns and want to kill your family? What's your point? No laws?

&gt; You can call it fear all you want, I call it being prepared. 

But you aren't prepared, so you cant call it that. You think everyone wants to hurt you and cowardly think you can't defend yourself with an inanimate object. Until you wear a parachute and lifejacket, you aren't really prepared are you. Funny how you only prepare for the thing that allows you to own your 'safety' blanket. 

&gt; I haven't proven any of your stupid points

And you just did it again. I wouldnt be able to make you look so foolish if you didn't keep telling me how you need a gun because you are scared everyone on the planet wants to kill your family. Being a paranoid coward is nothing to be proud of, son.

Maybe you want to live in a world where you can kill your family and innocent civilians all because you think you have the right to be a coward, but free people dont.

Maybe the logic your overlords feed you that has you believing that the only way to protect yourself from drunk drivers is to also drive drunk yourself makes sense to you because it justifies your remarkable cowardice.

unpopularopinion," It depends on exactly what they are doing. Everyone can be an asshole or snap. It's literally a problem with everyone, and I completely understand it.

 While I'm not an asshole myself? I'm more quiet and distant when I don't have caffeine. People who know me tend to pick up on that, because I am normally happy-go-lucky, and automatically assume I'm being a dick. I've legit had 30 people say that, including exes, because they expect me to be smiling and energetic all the time. Or talkative. 

 I worked as a ""Barista"" for years. Remember caffeine is a drug that you do withdrawal from, and that is understandable while someone isn't the same. I've seen people who are the nicest perk up when they drink it five minute later.

 So I don't usually take it personal. After working in the service industry my whole life I've learned it's normal. Even the nicest people become assholes and snap a bit. Not to mention the shit they are going through. 

 The key thing I look out for in someone snapping is an apology later. We are all human, and different. We all have our bad days, and I super appreciate it when someone apologizes about their behavior the next time I've seen them. You'd be surprised on how many apologies I've had weeks or months later. The way I see it is that people reflect and understood they took shit out on someone innocent.",0,3

AmItheAsshole,"^^^^AUTOMOD  ***The following is a copy of the above post. This comment is a record of the above post as it was originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***

About to be a dad in a few months. Mom is from an ONS, no further romantic interests pursued, but I do want to be part of the kids life in a big way. She does not want to do joint custody though. I don't tell a lot of people that I'm going to be a dad because it requires a lot of explaining about who the mom is, and ultimately I don't even have custody so I'm not even sure how big my role can be. It's not an active secret either though.

I recently met a girl (1-2 weeks ago). We've been talking A LOT every day about everything besides me becoming a dad. The conversation has minimal flirting, although there has been some romantic interest. I don't know what she wants from me and she's doing that thing where she says ""Idk, I'll see how things roll"", ""I just like getting to know people."" This continued even when we met up for dinner, which makes it feel a bit friend-zoney. 

I am planning to tell her about it tomorrow, but I want to mentally prepare for the backlash. Did I wait too long, AITA for not just being like ""Hey I don't know what you want, but you should know that I have this complicated kid situation coming up"" at the start?

My 2.5-year-old son despises brushing his teeth.  It's always been this way since we got him his first toothbrush.  He just does not like having the toothbrush in his mouth.  I have tried the Elmo brushing teeth song, as well as others but he will never let me brush his molars.  I got fed up tonight and searched for cavity cartoons on YouTube and watched the first video.  It was quite insightful, but as a 2.5-year-old learning that green germs live on the tooth completely traumatized him.  He now has a worried look on his face and no amount of encouragement is changing him.  Hopefully, his happy personality doesn't change because of this one video.   ITA dad that may have scarred him for life?

The very end was keeping alive seemingly the last human on earth and plopping a TV in front of it for them to just watch.

A player's chances with a club isn't just the game he started, it's every single day he's spent in the first team, or even the B team. Llorente is 24+ and a part of the club for ~10 years.

A lot of fans praised the additions of M.Llorente-Vallejo-T.Hernandez-Mayoral-Ceballos-Mariano along with the hiring of Lopetegui and as was blatantly evident in the last two years, the opinion of a lot of fans is worth jack shit hence why their input on the management of the club has zero impact.

I didn't urge the club to loan/sell M.Llorente in the summer but without a shadow of doubt he's contributed close to nothing in his two years in the first team. That's what I replied to, an often propagated lie.",0,-7

AmItheAsshole,"YTA, because of the way you reacted if nothing else. Adolescents masturbate: itвЂ™s *normal*. Of course, itвЂ™s completely your prerogative as to whether you think she should have a sex toy, but the truth of the matter is that youвЂ™ve handled the situation in one of the worst possible ways.

DonвЂ™t think she should have a vibrator? Okay, fine. Sit her down and explain why. Do not punish her for being curious, or for having sexual desires. ItвЂ™s likely that all youвЂ™ve accomplished by doing that is make her ashamed of what are completely natural desires.

The truth is that sheвЂ™s still going to masturbate. SheвЂ™s still gonna experiment, and sheвЂ™s still gonna question things, and if she really wants some sort of toy, sheвЂ™ll find a way to get one.

IвЂ™m usually for straight up equality, but this isnвЂ™t something thatвЂ™s equal - man and women have fundamentally different  plumbing down there. A woman who has lived with a vagina, clitorous, uterus, etc her whole like is absolutely more qualified to advise a daughter than a man who grew up his whole life with a penis. DadвЂ™s often learn for the first time that girls have to wipe front to back when they have daughters - most women donвЂ™t know how to gently stretch and clean an intact baby foreskin until they have sons without a circumcised penis. Puberty is tough enough without someone shaming you; it gets a lot easier if you have a nearby, non-judge mental resource for information and advice.

asoiaf,"Ah, the Last Jedi strategy. I think the Night King May have died with more left unexplained than Snoke, if thatвЂ™s possible. But maybe weвЂ™ll get some Bran-exposition on the Night King in the next episode(s)?

To me, itвЂ™s not so much that she killed him thatвЂ™s the real head scratcher, but that he died without ever explaining or saying anything. We were set up and told that he was a person, then he survived the fire, so maybe he was a Targaryen, and he seemed to even smile when the fire didnвЂ™t work on him, which suggests some level of emotion and feeling, and he has left symbols in the past to send messages, suggesting a level of critical thinking and awareness, and we were set up for a meeting with Bran, but then heвЂ™s just offed without even saying a word.

And why did he take his sweet time not killing Arya when he caught her? If he was a person with feelings and motives, I get the delay and the taunting, savoring it, but considering he got absolutely zero dialogue or anything, he seems more like just a force of nature than a living human being, which would make him slowing down and delaying an easy kill a really out of character move for a force of nature. He could have killed her in an instant; heвЂ™s pretty much superhuman.

TL;DR: we seemed set up to see the NK fleshed out with some motivation and personality, but he didnвЂ™t get it, which makes his smiling when hit with fire and his not killing Arya right away when he caught her inconsistent with his seeming to be merely a force of nature.

Way too young to buy a sex toy, are you kidding me?

Most people refuse to try to understand context across multiple comments so I don't bother to explain things. They usualy throw a short response, downvote and move along so I respond in a similar fashion. The consequences are obvious, you end up downvoted for being an asshole but frankly I am ok with that. You showed an effort to understand so I elaborated on my point of view. Would like to say sorry to you for being an asshole but my asshole response was more so directed to the general responses I normally recieve and not towards you personally. Edit nope actually I am wrong here I threw out a name earlier and that was personal I am sorry for that it was uncalled for.",0,0

Or maybe Captain Marvel showed up, beat the snot out of him, and that timeline never had to worry about a snap. There's no way to really know how it went down.",0,2

AskReddit,"As a nursing student, my preceptor and I were assigned a 78 year old woman admitted for not having a bowel movement for 14 DAYS and for abdominal pain. She had gotten a CT scan a day prior to the day we took care of her showing that there wasnвЂ™t any bowel obstruction or any other bowel issues we needed to worry about. The doctors decide to put her on all kinds of bowel prep, laxatives, and stool softeners as a preventative measure. They just wanted her to poop before they could discharge her.
Around halfway through the shift, I am doing my hourly rounding on our patients and I see that she is shaking, drenched with sweat, and barely conscious (she was sitting up talking on the phone the hour before). I run to tell my preceptor and she says itвЂ™s probably just because she really needs to poop, and that she was gonna get an order for an enema. I insist on getting her something for pain. Luckily we are able to get her some morphine and the preceptor also got the enema. As sheвЂ™s positioning her to give her the enema my eyes went wide and I said firmly вЂњSTOP.вЂќ The preceptor followed my eyes to the PROLAPSED UTERUS hanging out of the patientвЂ™s vagina. Long story short, we call an OB and the OB puts the uterus back where it belongs so we assume we resolved the issue. An hour after resolving the prolapse, the patient starts having pain again. 
She kept saying вЂњNo, please donвЂ™t leave me. IвЂ™m going to die in this hospital. IвЂ™m not going home. Please, please stay with me. I donвЂ™t wanna die alone. I donвЂ™t wanna die alone!вЂќ It broke my heart. 
I sat with her for 2 hours until my shift ended. We talked about her pet chihuahua, her two kids and her many grandkids. She told me how independent she was, and how she didnвЂ™t wanna bother her kids. The last thing she said to me was вЂњThank you for not leaving me alone. I will miss you.вЂќ She looked so calm, almost serene. She was smiling warmly at me. I didnвЂ™t think anything of it and I said, вЂњIt was my pleasure, IвЂ™ll miss you too. I hope you start feeling better soon!вЂќ 
I came back 2 weeks later to find out she died not long after I left. It turns out she had 3 bowel obstructions (that the CT didnвЂ™t catch until after) and one of them ruptured. She never made it to the OR. IвЂ™ll never forget that sinking feeling when I found out. She was alone...IвЂ™d like I at least helped alleviate that feeling, but she still died alone and thatвЂ™s what gets me.",0,10
